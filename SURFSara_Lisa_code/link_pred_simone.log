Detailed measurement of RT, IIV, errors, and practice effects therefore reveal a degree of functional impairment in brain processing not apparent by measuring RT in isolation.', b'2019-11-25', b'methodology', b'Intra-individual variability', b'reaction time', b'Subcortical Ischemic Vascular Cognitive Impairment: Insights from Reaction Time Measures']

From these very high production volumes ever larger quantities are found in the environment. There the plastics degradate to microplasticity and spread ubiquitously in the world. The present work deals with the possible uptake of microplastic particles in human organisms. For the detection of these plastic particles, an extraction method was developed and validated.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biological materials consist of human blood (healthy volunteers, n = 4) and different tissues of pigs and cattles. Various lysis solutions were tested for degradation efficiency of biological material and for effects on the plastics. The mass loss, surfaces and structure variations as well as the physicochemical spectrum of the material were observed after treatment by atomic force (AFM) and electron microscopy (EM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR).   RESULTS: The different plastic types as polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) could be clearly differentiated and identified by FTIR. Regarding the surface control, especially PVC showed detectable alterations: After extraction an irregular surface structure caused by protuberances or bubbles could be observed. However, instead of these alterations an equivalent count of plastic particles was found in correlation to the applied plastic amount (recovery rate overall was 99,12\xc2\xb10,67%).   CONCLUSION: The applied method can be used for plastic extractions from human or animal tissues without remarkable effects on the plastics.', b'microparticel']

Adaptive techniques when employed in e-learning can sustain the interest and motivation of the learners and help them to complete the enrolled courses successfully. In addition, it would improve their performance and thus, enhance the overall learning experience. Personalisation takes into consideration the characteristics of the individual learner and the diversity in his/her needs. The main challenge is finding a match between these individual characteristics and the sequence of the learning content. It is a complex task to implement as it involves selection of the appropriate material from a vast amount of the available learning materials. It is a challenge to perform this process manually as it requires both technical savvy and pedagogical skills. In this paper, a stigmergy model is proposed, which was applied to build a customised learning path. The aim was to provide personalisation that satisfied the needs of an individual in a widely heterogeneous e-learning environment. Compared with the traditional teaching method, this tailored learning path, generated using the proposed approach, shows promise and was found to enhance the performance of the learners.', b'ant colony optimisation', b'A modified ant colony algorithm for personalized learning path construction']

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the water quality and the process of changes in the water quality parameters of this river by graphic methods such as Wilcox, Schuler and Piper diagrams. These charts were used to monitor water quality and evaluate the data obtained from Berthaen Station from 1976 to 2007. In this study, Piper introduced water qualitative type of chlorine and water fa\xc3\xa7ade from saddle type. Based on the Schuler diagram, all water samples of the river Rudan are in a moderate and acceptable category for drinking and there is no barrier to drinking. The Wilcox chart also shows that most of the specimens are highly salty and suitable for farming (C3S1, C3S2) and in some water are poor, highly unsuitable water areas (C4S2). The results of water quality parameters analysis using non-parametric Mann-Kendall test showed that the parameters of acidity, carbonate, soluble salts, total cations, sodium, magnesium and chloride adsorption percentages, and other parameters were not trendy at the surface The confidence is 95%.

METHOD: In this prospective open randomised monocentric study 19 patients (age \xe2\x89\xa565, movement restrictions and symptomatic leg oedema) received knee-length compression stockings with an interface pressure of 18\xe2\x80\x9321 mmHg (stocking type 1) and 23\xe2\x80\x9332 mmHg (stocking type 2). On two consecutive days each of the two compression stocking types were worn for at least 8 hours. After this test period, both stocking types were assessed subjectively and skin changes were recorded.   RESULT: A significantly (p-value <0.001) subjective improvement of the symptoms and complaints based on leg oedema was reported with the knee-length compression stockings. The Stocking type 1 recorded a significantly (p = 0,045) better wearing comfort. In addition, the Stocking type 2 was significantly too large amongst women in the front foot area (p = 0.044). The most common side effects were constrictions on the proximal lower leg (stocking type 1 = 73,7% (14/19); stocking type 2 = 78,9% (15/19)). Subjects with arthritis (p = 0.006), hallux valgus (p = 0.034) and/or digitus flexus (p = 0.021) found the socking type 1 significantly more comfortable.   CONCLUSION: In order to achieve optimal patient compliance it is recommended to prescribe knee-length compression stockings with an interface pressure of 18\xe2\x80\x9321 mmHg if the following criteria are met: age \xe2\x89\xa565 years, female sex, arthritis, digitus flexus (claw toe) or hallux valgus.', b'chronic venous insufficiency', b'Better wearing comfort of knee-length elastic compression stockings with an interface pressure of 18\xe2\x80\x9321 mmHg compared to 23\xe2\x80\x9332 mmHg in elderly people after a one day trial \xe2\x80\x93 Influence on foot deformities, rheumatism and arthritis', b'quality of life', b'wearing comfort', b'2019-11-12']

The external assistive force might disturb the user\xe2\x80\x99s motor control system during the process of assisted training using power assist suit, thus affect the progress of rehabilitation. With the consideration of the non-negligible physiological differences between upper limbs, this study focused on the physiological responses of the two arms against the external assistive force.   OBJECTIVE:  To investigate and contrast the impact of assistive force on dominant and non-dominant arms during unilateral isometric elbow flexion.   METHODS:  Participants were instructed to adjust force exertion to a target value based on the visual feedback. Task performances including muscle activity of agonist and antagonist muscles, force steadiness and rated perceived exertion were evaluated at multiple workload and assistive load conditions.   RESULTS:  No significant differences in muscle activity of agonist and antagonist muscles between the two arms. In contrast, the dominant arm showed a higher assist efficiency at a low assistive level, whereas the non-dominant arm had a lower level of force fluctuation during a unilateral force matching task.   CONCLUSIONS:  Both arms could utilize the assistive force to reduce muscle activity. However, the two arms showed different abilities in response to external assistive force. This indicates distinct motor control strategies for each arm and implicates the necessity of side-individualized rehabilitative approach for achieving a better training effect.', b'force steadiness', b'2019-11-19', b'Unilateral', b'isometric elbow flexion']

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to identify work accommodations that are available and that are provided to individuals with mental disorders. In addition, associated cost-effectiveness and cost-benefits of these accommodations are examined.   METHODS: Studies published between 1990\xe2\x80\x932016 from four databases were reviewed. From these databases, studies that specified accommodations that were available/provided and/or addressed cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis of work accommodations were included.   RESULTS: Of the 1362 eligible studies, only 15 were included. Work accommodations that were provided to individuals assisted in mitigating limitations in the work place and improved length of job tenure, as well as reduced the severity of certain mental disorders. The costs associated with these accommodations were found to be minimal and had positive economic benefits for employers.

Previous related studies are reviewed and we discuss how the boundaries of what can be done with smartphones for data collection and experimental purposes can be pushed further to allow for complex behavioral studies. Results from a pilot study are presented to discuss the feasibility and potential of this approach. The pilot shows that studying social dilemma behavior via smartphones is feasible and has potential value as a behavioral intervention tool.', b'living laboratory', b'social dilemma', b'sustainability', b'environmental behavior', b'Field-experiment', b'smartphone data', b'2019-11-24', b'Advancing sustainability: Using smartphones to study environmental behavior in a field-experimental setup']

This study\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was to investigate the musculoskeletal problems distribution and related factors among academicians.   METHODS:  This study was performed by using a personal and professional information questionnaire, the Extended Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form.   RESULTS:  The study was completed with 142 academicians (89 female, 53 male). Mean age was 39.91 \xc2\xb1 8.90 years, physical activity level was 1067.31 \xc2\xb1 1866.95 MET-minute/week, and work time was 13.73 \xc2\xb1 9.15 years. Neck and lower back pain were mostly seen in academicians and their incidence was equal (63.4%). The most experienced pain the previous year was neck pain (39.4%), and upper back pain is the most experienced pain today (19%). The body part that mostly caused the use of medication is neck pain (23%), and mostly caused limitation and sick-leave was low back in the past 12 months (respectively 19.7% and 9.2%). Gender, body mass index, weekly workload, physical activity level, and marital status have been determined to have an effect on musculoskeletal problems in academicians (p< 0.05).   CONCLUSION:  The most common musculoskeletal problems reported by academicians were in the upper back and neck regions, which have low level physical activity.', b'Musculoskeletal problems in academicians and related factors in Turkey', b'occupational health', b'pain']

One to two weeks later, a significantly better cognitive performance was noticed in the mitochondria treated AD-mice relative to vehicle treated AD-mice, approaching the performance of non-AD mice. We also detected a significant decrease in neuronal loss and reduced gliosis in the hippocampus of treated mice relative to untreated AD-mice. An amelioration of the mitochondrial dysfunction in brain was noticed by the increase of citrate-synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activities relative to untreated AD-mice, reaching activity levels of non-AD-mice. Increased mitochondrial activity was also detected in the liver of mitochondria treated mice. No treatment-related toxicity was noted. Thus, IV mitochondrial transfer may possibly offer a novel therapeutic approach for AD.', b'amyloid-ICV model', b'2019-11-11', b'mitochondria', b'Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease', b'mitochondrial-transfer', b'cognition']

OBJECTIVE: This work assessed the influence of different drying methods: freeze drying (FD), convective drying (CD), vacuum drying (VD), sun drying (SD), and infrared drying (IRD) on the antimicrobial activity of murta berries against four microbial species.   METHODS: Murta berries were subjected to five drying methods.

Determination of antioxidant capacity by DPPH and ORAC methods and antimicrobial activity by means of agar well diffusion assay.   RESULTS: Murta extracts obtained by FD and CD showed the highest antimicrobial activity, with Staphylococcus aureus the most susceptible species. Drying induced a significant loss of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity although minimal losses were observed in FD, CD and VD extracts. In these extracts, the abundance of bioactive compounds correlated with the antimicrobial activity. Eight phenolic compounds were identified in murta extracts where pyrogallol\xe2\x80\x99s abundance increased in all dried samples.

This work proposes an inequality approach to evaluate the performances of DMUs. Inequalities consist of expressions of the production possibility set and the line segments joining the evaluated DMU to the positive output-axes. However, in real-world application involving performance measurement, inputs and outputs are often imprecise and fluctuated. In this case, a fuzzy inequality approach is proposed to evaluate the performances. What is more, fuzzy relative efficiency is dependent upon the number of solutions. Furthermore, the minimal element is used to distinguish the fuzzy relative efficient DMUs. Finally, two numerical examples are used to illustrate the fuzzy approach and compare the results with those obtained with alternative fuzzy approaches.', b'A fuzzy inequality evaluation approach for measuring the relative efficiency']

The role of Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) as a first line investigation in diagnosing breast lesions is well documented, however histopathology is the gold standard. Cyto-histopathological correlation is of great relevance and also increases precision.   AIMS \\& OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted with the aim to categorize breast lesions according to the latest standardized reporting system proposed by International academy of cytologists (IAC) in 2016. Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of FNAC in diagnosing breast lesions and cyto-histopathological correlation was planned.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: All FNAs of breast lesions over a period of 2 years were included in the study. The cases were grouped into five standardized categories proposed by the International academy of cytology: Category I (Insufficient material), Category II (Benign), Category III (Atypical, probably benign), Category IV (Suspicious, probably in situ or invasive) & Category V (Malignant) respectively. Specificity, sensitivity, diagnostic accuracy, negative and positive predictive value of FNAC were calculated and cyto-histopathological correlation assessed wherever possible.   RESULTS: Out of 468 breast lesions reported on FNAC, the category wise distribution was \xe2\x80\x93 Category I, II, III, IV & V accounting for 23(4.9%), 342(73.07%), 7(1.5%), 11(2.35%) and 85(18.16%) respectively. Histopathology was performed in 331/468 cases with cyto histological concordance of 98.4% and a type agreement rate of 90.9%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy was 98.90%, 99.16%, 97.82%, 99.58% and 99.09% respectively.   CONCLUSION: FNAC is a simple, reliable, cost effective, first line diagnostic procedure for all breast lumps. In collaboration with physical examination and imaging studies (triple approach), FNAC is a highly sensitive diagnostic tool. Adopting a universally acceptable standardized reporting system for breast cytology can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FNAC.', b'breast lesions', b'IAC', b'cyto-histopathological correlation']

In the present study, three PHB producers belonging to cyanobacteria were identified as Oscillatoria salina, Anabaena cylindrica and Nostoc linckia, based on their morphological features and microscopic observations. Their growth and PHB production after 7, 14 and 21 days in BG11 medium were determined. The highest dry weight for the isolates was observed at stationary phase (14 days) and PHB accumulation (%, w/w of dry cells) increased with increasing dry weight up to 14 days, then a decline was observed after 21 days. At the stationary phase, cells of O. salina, A. cylindrica and N. linckia accumulated PHB up to 13.62, 11.88 and 10.03% (w/w of dry cells), respectively. The pH values between 8 and 9 were preferred for PHB accumulation. O. salina, A. cylindrica and N. linckia accumulated the highest PHB 17.31, 15.22 and 14.95%, respectively at pH 8. Nitrogen and phosphorus starvation were found stimulatory for PHB accumulation and he highest PHB production was recorded for O. salina, 20.41 and 26.32%, respectively after 14 days of incubation.

Good evidence suggests that dementia risk is increased among widowed individuals; however, it is not clear if they are being diagnosed in routine primary care.   Objective: This study aimed to investigate if bereavement influenced the probability of having received a dementia diagnosis.   Methods: A population-based cohort study using UK electronic health records, between 1997 and 2017, among 247,586 opposite-sex partners. Those experiencing partner bereavement were matched (age, sex, and date of bereavement) to a non-bereaved person living in a partnership. Multivariate cox regression was performed.   Results: Partner bereavement was associated with an increased risk of receiving a diagnosis of dementia in the first three months (hazard ratio (HR) 1.43, 95% CI 1.20\xe2\x80\x931.71) and first six months (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.09\xe2\x80\x931.41), while there was a small reduced risk of getting a dementia diagnosis over all follow-up (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89\xe2\x80\x930.98).   Conclusions: Partner bereavement appears to lead to a short-term increased risk of the surviving partner receiving a diagnosis of dementia, suggesting that bereavement unmasks existing undiagnosed dementia. Over the longer term, however, bereaved individuals are less likely to have a diagnosis of dementia in their health records than non-bereaved individuals.', b'Bereavement', b'epidemiology', b'Clinical Practice Research Datalink']

Since WSNs typically have no infrastructure, one of the challenges in WSNs is the lack of appropriate method for an operator to interact with the WSN. Practical tasks for WSNs require sensor node adaptive to changes in WSN configuration, user input, and commands hence, monitoring and interaction with the WSN is needed. In this paper, a new scheme for configuration dissemination with monitoring of sensor state is proposed to control dynamically sensor node operation in real time. Moreover, a method is provided for the operator to observe the state of the sensor node, which helps the operator provide an appropriate control input to the WSN. We prove the stability properties of the proposed algorithm and show the simulation results.', b'dissemination', b'Wireless sensor networks', b'2019-11-19']

Objective: To determine how drug exposure is related to treatment response.   Methods: A sensitive plasma assay for the drug was used in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of samples from 1,162 of the 1,686 patients who participated in either of the Phase III trials with available samples and efficacy outcome data.   Results: There are steep concentration-response relationships for steady state plasma levels in the range 0.3\xe2\x80\x930.8 ng/ml at the 8 mg/day dose. Using a threshold based on the lower limit of quantitation of the assay on Day 1, there are highly significant differences in cognitive decline and brain atrophy in patients with above threshold plasma levels, both for monotherapy and add-on therapy, but with effect sizes reduced by half as add-on. Plasma concentrations in the range 4\xe2\x80\x9321 ng/ml produced by the high doses are not associated with any additional benefit.   Conclusions: Hydromethylthionine has pharmacological activity on brain structure and function at the 8 mg/day dose as monotherapy or as add-on to symptomatic treatments. This combined with a plateau at higher doses is consistent with the lack of dose-response seen in the Phase III trials. Treatment benefit is predicted to be maximal at 16 mg/day as monotherapy.

Considering the cross-talking between the central nervous system and the periphery, the inflammatory analytes may provide utility as biomarkers to identify AD at earlier stages.   Objective: Using an advanced statistical approach, we can discriminate the interactive network of cytokines/chemokines and propose a useful tool to follow the progression and evolution of AD, also in light of sex differences.   Methods: A cohort of 289 old-age subjects was screened for cytokine and chemokine profiling, measured in plasma, after a thorough clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. A custom algorithm based on Fisher linear discriminant analysis was applied to ascertain a classification signature able to discriminate HC from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.   Results: We observed that a joint expression of three proteins (a \xe2\x80\x9csignature\xe2\x80\x9d composed by IFN-\xce\xb12, IL-1\xce\xb1, TNF\xce\xb1) can discriminate HC from AD with an accuracy of 65.24%. Using this signature on MCI samples, 84.93% of them were classified as \xe2\x80\x9cnon-HC\xe2\x80\x9d.

Bergenin (Berg), extracted from the herb of Saxifrage stolonifera Curt. (Hu-Er-Cao), has anti-tumor, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, and neuroprotective properties.   Objective: In this study, we wanted to investigate the effects of Berg on PD and the underlying mechanisms.   Methods: 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was used to introduce PD symptoms in mice. The expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, and Iba-1 were examined. The levels of a series of inflammatory mediators were measured by qPCR. In addition, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was investigated to illustrate the underlying mechanism. In vitro, PC12 cells subjected to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with Berg.   Results: We found that MPTP injection introduced motor deficits, apoptosis of neurons and inflammation, as well as inhibited the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. However, Berg treatment suppressed the MPTP-induced alterations. In vitro, Berg attenuated the cytotoxic effects on PC12 cells induced by the culture supernatants derived from LPS-induced microglial cells.   Conclusion: Berg attenuated the PD symptoms via activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.', b'Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease', b'bergenin']

METHODS: Evaluation of tissue oxygenation was performed in the angiosome of the medial plantar artery in 25 healthy young people and in 24 patients with and 25 patients without PAD in comparable age.

Participants shot to the target at random visual signals placed behind the target before and after fatigue. In order to measure wrist acceleration and ball speed, an accelerometer and a radar gun are used respectively and numbers of accurate and inaccurate shots also recorded.   RESULTS:  There were no significant differences between pre-fatigue and post-fatigue protocols in terms of accurate and inaccurate shots, and ball speed. Only wrist acceleration in the Y axis (Mpre - fatigue= 33.12, SD = 1.17msec; Mpost - fatigue= 34.50, SD = 1.21msec) was affected by the fatigue protocol in inaccurate shots (p= 0.042).

In the psychosocial work environment of hazardous industries like petrochemicals where production lasts twenty-four hours a day and continues seven-days-a-week, a psychologically available worker is extremely important. Psychological availability refers to when workers who are physically, emotionally and psychologically engaged at the moment of performing tasks.   OBJECTIVE: The broad objective of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect effects of behavioral factors on the psychological and physiological health of workers.   METHODS: The latest, second generation technique, which is structural equation modeling, is used to identify the relationships between behavioral antecedents and health outcomes. A total of 277 technical workers participated, aged between 20 and 49 and were healthy in all aspects.   RESULTS: The study results showed quantitative demands, emotional demands, work-family conflict, and job insecurity were significantly associated with both psychological (stress) and physiological (Body Mass Index) factors. The social support of colleagues produced mixed findings with direct and indirect paths. Stress also significantly mediates the psychosocial factors and burnout of the workers.   CONCLUSION: The study concluded that workers were physically available, but they experienced distractions as members of social systems, affecting their physiological and psychological health.', b'work', b'2019-11-20', b'Connotations of psychological and physiological health in the psychosocial work environment: An industrial context', b'Health', b'psychosocial', b'physiological']

OBJECTIVE: We propose an approach centered on the involvement of workers at all hierarchical levels around \xe2\x80\x9cintermediary objects\xe2\x80\x9d of prevention in order to foster a collective debate. This might provide empowered workers to be actors into their own prevention of risk faced.   METHODS: Observational data was coupled with chemical and physiological measurements. We developed, reworked and enriched the notion of risk representation, which promotes the visibility and recognition of the knowledge built, developed and held by workers on their activities and on ways to protect themselves from dangers or hazards.   RESULTS: Implementation of the method generates detailed knowledge of chemical risks, knowledge that is constructed by the workers. This knowledge is made possible by the experience of the body and senses, and becomes accessible via references to the domestic and professional sphere in reflexive activities. The actors get involved and make use of their individual, collective and organizational resources to propose prevention solutions   CONCLUSIONS: Use of intermediate prevention objects in an \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate space for dialogue\xe2\x80\x9d allows dialogues to be produced and fostered. Ultimately, these spaces are circulating entities for the co-production of knowledge for action: to generate knowledge and innovative prevention solutions collectively.', b'risk representation']

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the importance of job demands, job resources, and personal resources for health-related outcomes, as well as the mitigating effects of resources, among women working within the Swedish welfare sector.   METHODS: Self-reports from 372 women employed within the welfare sector were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression.   RESULTS: Overall, increasing job demands were associated with poorer health outcomes while increasing job resources and personal resources were associated with better health. Additionally, lower control aggravated the effects of quantitative job demands on health outcomes while lower feedback mitigated the effect of qualitative demands. However, personal resources had no moderating effect.

Main and interaction effects on health-related outcomes among women working within the welfare sector', b'BACKGROUND: Overall, health-related correlates of job demands and job resources are well-known. However, in today\xe2\x80\x99s working life, personal resources are considered to be of increasing importance. Beyond general mental ability, knowledge regarding personal resources remains limited. This is particularly so among women working in the welfare sector, a sector mainly employing women and with the work typically involving clients.   OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the importance of job demands, job resources, and personal resources for health-related outcomes, as well as the mitigating effects of resources, among women working within the Swedish welfare sector.   METHODS: Self-reports from 372 women employed within the welfare sector were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression.   RESULTS: Overall, increasing job demands were associated with poorer health outcomes while increasing job resources and personal resources were associated with better health. Additionally, lower control aggravated the effects of quantitative job demands on health outcomes while lower feedback mitigated the effect of qualitative demands. However, personal resources had no moderating effect.   CONCLUSIONS: Job resources seem more pertinent to health than personal resources, at least among women working within the welfare sector in Sweden.']

RESULTS: Independent sample t-test shows statistically significant differences in sagittal spinal deformities with increased thoracic kyphosis and spinal flexion in young children than elder children (P = .000, t = 10.72). However, young children show lesser lordosis than elder children (P = .001, t = \xe2\x80\x934.47). In addition, the young children established a higher significant coefficient of compensation (CC) than elder children (P = .000 t = 12.58).   CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the forward flexion of the trunk is more common among young children than elder children. This may be attributed to differences in postural awareness and way of sitting among students of elementary school. So, it is recommended to encourage the proper postures among students of first graders especially young children.', b'A comparison of sagittal spine deformities among elementary school students using spinal mouse device']

Attenuation of Mycobacterium bovis for clinical use as BCG results in loss of its ability to activate the \xe2\x80\x9cStimulator of Interferon Genes\xe2\x80\x9d (STING) pathway and potentially limits local anti-tumor immune activity and subsequent BCG responsiveness due to reduced induction of the immune cell recruiting chemokines primarily, CXCL10. We conducted the current study to determine the potential of STING pathway agonist in synergizing with BCG to enhance chemokine induction.   Methods: The TICE strain of BCG (OncoTICE) was used in combination with STING agonist to determine STING pathway activation and CXCL10 production in THP-1 monocytic cell line, THP-1 defNLRP3, THP-1 dual STING knock out cells, RT112 bladder cancer cells and primary bladder epithelial cells. NanoString platform-based gene expression profiling and multiplex cytokine analysis were performed to determine induction of interferon associated genes and secreted cytokines.   Results: Activation of cytosolic pattern recognition receptor and downstream IFN1 pathways demonstrated synergistic activation of STING pathway enhanced BCG induced inflammasome and STING pathway gene expression in monocytes and bladder cancer cells. The significant differences in CXCL10, CCL5, IL-8 and MIP-1a/1b amongst the knock-out cell lines confirm the convergence of these pathways following combination treatment with BCG and STING agonist.   Conclusions: Findings from our study are the first evidence indicating that STING pathway activators are promising new innate immune modulators with a potential to synergize with BCG therapy in the treatment of NMIBC.']

We propose a hierarchical classifier to perform two-phase learning. In the first phase the classifier learns general features to recognise majority classes, and the second phase is to collect minority and subtle classes to identify fine difference between them. We compare our proposal with a collection of state-of-the-art classification techniques on four real-world third-party datasets that involve different types of object sensors and are collected in different environments and on different subjects and six imbalanced datasets from the UCI-Irvine Machine Learning repository. Our results demonstrate that our hierarchical classifier approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques including both structure- and feature-based learning techniques. The key novelty of our approach is that we reduce the bias of the ensemble classifier by training it on a subspace of data, which allows identification of activities with subtle differences, and thus provides well-discriminating features.', b'2019-11-18', b'representation learning', b'sampling techniques', b'ensemble learning', b'smart home']

Previous research argues that higher education helps to preserve cognition in older adults with AD pathology because of its key role in cognitive reserve and resilience.   Objective: To test if higher educational level buffers the effect of APOE \xc9\x9b4 on cognition among older non-Hispanic Blacks.   Methods: Participants were 849 non-demented older non-Hispanic Blacks (38.3% APOE \xc9\x9b4+), who underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Multiple linear regression models tested the relationship between APOE \xc9\x9b4 status and twelve cognitive measures with education (up to high school and beyond high school) as a moderator.   Results: Education buffered the effects of the APOE \xc9\x9b4 allele, such that there was no impact of APOE \xc9\x9b4 status on word-list memory retention and working memory among participants with more than a high school degree. This pattern was not observed for ten other cognitive measures of verbal and visual episodic memory, semantic memory, executive function, and processing speed\xe2\x80\x94although a similar trend was observed for switching ability in executive functioning.

Objective: To test if higher educational level buffers the effect of APOE \xc9\x9b4 on cognition among older non-Hispanic Blacks.   Methods: Participants were 849 non-demented older non-Hispanic Blacks (38.3% APOE \xc9\x9b4+), who underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Multiple linear regression models tested the relationship between APOE \xc9\x9b4 status and twelve cognitive measures with education (up to high school and beyond high school) as a moderator.   Results: Education buffered the effects of the APOE \xc9\x9b4 allele, such that there was no impact of APOE \xc9\x9b4 status on word-list memory retention and working memory among participants with more than a high school degree. This pattern was not observed for ten other cognitive measures of verbal and visual episodic memory, semantic memory, executive function, and processing speed\xe2\x80\x94although a similar trend was observed for switching ability in executive functioning. The buffering effect of education was stronger among women than men.   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that genetic effects on late-life cognition may be modified by environmental factors such as educational attainment. These results are consistent with the framework of cognitive reserve such that engaging in cognitively enriching activities and acquiring skills and knowledge with more years of education may increase the capacity to maintain cognitive function despite high genetic risk for impairment.', b'2019-11-11', b'educational attainment', b'Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease']

In the present study, we evaluated patients with suspicion of clinically significant PCa on mpMRI, but histopathologically proven Gleason 6 PCa in Fbx.   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2015 and 2019, 849 patients underwent Fbx and concurrent systematic 12-core biopsy at our department. 234 patients were diagnosed with Gleason 6 PCa in either mpMRI-targeted and/or concurrent systematic biopsy. Patients were analyzed regarding PSA, mpMRI findings according to PI-RADS classification, histopathological results of Fbx and systematic 12-core biopsy. 99/234 patients were also analyzed in regards of histopathology of the whole-mount specimen of subsequent radical prostatectomy (RP).   RESULTS: In 131/234 patients (56%), Gleason 6 PCa was detected in the mpMRI target. In 103/234 patients (44%), Gleason 6 PCa was detected in the concurrent systematic 12-core biopsy with negative mpMRI-targeted biopsy. Men with evidence of Gleason 6 in the mpMRI target had significantly higher amounts of overall positive biopsies (median 4 vs. 2, p < 0.001) and higher maximum tumor infiltration per biopsy core (30% vs. 20%, p < 0.001) compared to men with negative mpMRI-targeted biopsy.

Methods: THP-1-derived macrophages were stimulated in vitro with A\xce\xb242 or with A\xce\xb242 after LPS-priming in the presence/absence of D4T. NLRP3 and TREM2 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR; phagocytosis, as well as ASC-Speck formation, was analyzed by Amnis FlowSight Imaging; NLRP3-produced cytokines were quantified by ELISA and, finally, autophagy was analyzed by measuring p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, beclin, p70-S6Kinase, and Lamp by ELISA and western blot.   Results: IL-1\xce\xb2, IL-18, and caspase-1 were increased whereas A\xce\xb2 phagocytosis and TREM2 were reduced in LPS+A\xce\xb242-stimulated cells.

Notably, whereas D4T reduced A\xce\xb2 phagocytosis, A\xce\xb2 autophagy by macrophages was stimulated by D4T, as witnessed by the down-modulation of ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation and the upregulation of beclin, LAMP, and p70-S6K, their downstream targets.

We have found that chronic systemic exposure to lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) induces the accumulation of A\xce\xb2 in the brain of middle-aged mice. On the other hand, recent research has shown that circulating A\xce\xb2 is transferred into the brain; however, the involvement of chronic systemic P. gingivalis infection in the peripheral A\xce\xb2 metabolism is unknown. We hypothesized that chronic P. gingivalis infection expands A\xce\xb2 pools in peripheral inflammatory tissues and thereby contributes to the accumulation of A\xce\xb2 in the brain of patients with periodontitis. We showed that the increased expression of IL-1\xce\xb2, A\xce\xb2PP770, CatB, A\xce\xb21-42, and A\xce\xb23-42 was mainly co-localized with macrophages in the liver of P. gingivalis infected mice. Blocking CatB and NF-\xce\xbaB significantly inhibited the P. gingivalis-induced expression of IL-1\xce\xb2, A\xce\xb2PP770, A\xce\xb21-42, and A\xce\xb23-42 in RAW264.7 cells. A\xce\xb23-42, but not A\xce\xb21-42, induced the significant death of macrophages, and the reduction of phagocytic abilities induced by A\xce\xb23-42 tended to be higher than that induced by A\xce\xb21-42. Additionally, the expression of A\xce\xb2PP770, CatB, A\xce\xb21-42, and A\xce\xb23-42 was determined in the macrophages of gingival tissues from periodontitis patients. These findings indicate that chronic systemic P. gingivalis infection induces the A\xce\xb2 accumulation in inflammatory monocytes/macrophages via the activation of CatB/NF-\xce\xbaB signaling, thus suggesting monocytes/macrophages serve as a circulating pool of A\xce\xb2 in patients with periodontitis.

Stenting restores blood perfusion to ischemic areas, but it also causes mechanical disruption of the atheromatous plaque and the nearby endothelium, stimulating the activation of platelets. In a similar way, platelets are activated by thrombin exposure in the setting of plaque rupture. The interaction between platelets, oxidative stress and inflammation is an important factor determining the extent and severity of vascular dysfunction observed in these settings. Platelets activated by the vessel trauma release inflammatory and mitogenic mediators into the vascular microenvironment, activating leukocyte chemotaxis and switching the endothelial phenotypefrom a quiescent to an activate one. The increased bioavailability of reactive oxygen species from the vessel wall, from leukocytes and from platelets, and the subsequent decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide, further stimulates platelets, which are otherwise inhibited by this endothelial mediator. Thus, inflammation, oxidative stress and platelet activation cooperate in a feed-forward mechanism leading to vascular dysfunction and possibly compromising the effect of stenting. Inhibitors of platelet function have thus important ancillary effects beyond their antithrombotic ones, which will be discussed in the present short review.', b'2019-11-12', b'stent', b'Endothelium', b'thrombosis', b'acute coronary syndromes', b'The pleiotropic effects of antiplatelet therapies']

Then, different operations are defined based on basic algebras and the relationship between semicontinuity and continuity of operations is considered. In addition, the separation axioms on (semi) topological basic algebras are investigated by considering some conditions implying that a (semi) topological basic algebra becomes a Ti- space, for i \xe2\x88\x88 {0, 1, 2}. In the sequel, some relations between (weak) ideals and (weak) filters of basic algebras are obtained and (left) topological (implication) basic algebra is constructed by using the concepts of (weak) filters, which is a zero dimensional, normal, disconnected, locally compact and completely regular (left) topological space. Further, the notion of quotient basic algebras are presented along with evaluating the interaction of topological basic algebras and topological quotient basic algebras. Finally, it is proved that there is an implication basic algebra    IB *    with cardinality n + 1 and filter F* = F \xe2\x88\xaa {z*}, which    z *  \xe2\x88\x89 IB   for any implication basic algebra   IB   of cardinality n and filter F.

Neural network is easy to be identified with available training algorithm, but it cannot directly describe the multi-valued mapping of hysteresis. A neural-Preisach model was proposed for modeling and control of piezoelectric stack actuators. The neural-Preisach model inherits the advantages of Preisach model and neural network, which can describe the hysteresis and update parameters by training algorithm. A feedforward controller was designed with the inverse neural-Preisach model, and then experiments of tracking control were performed to validate the effectiveness of the neural-Preisach model. The maximal error, in case of feedforward and PID controller, is reduced by 83.97%, comparing with the case without control. This indicates that control accuracy with hysteresis compensation is greatly improved compared to that without hysteresis compensation.', b'Hysteresis modeling and tracking control for piezoelectric stack actuators using neural-Preisach model', b'2019-11-10', b'hysteresis nonlinearity', b'Piezoelectric stack actuators', b'Preisach model', b'neural network']

Pregnancy is a critical stage of development during which maternal nutrition can strongly influence obstetric and neonatal outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of pregnancy on the full blood count parameters of pregnant women of African descent residing in Sokoto, North Western Nigeria. This case-control study investigated 74 pregnant subjects and 22 non-pregnant controls. The mean age and income of the subjects were 28.00 \xc2\xb1 8.295 and 2760.42 \xc2\xb1 7975.178 respectively. Haematological parameters were determined using a fully automated 5-part differential haematology analyzer (Model Mythic 22-CT, Orpheee, Switzerland). Results obtained of pregnant subjects were compared with that of non-pregnant controls. The prevalence of anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (Platelet count < 140 \xc3\x97 109/L) was 58.11% and 6.75% respectively among the pregnant subjects. The mean haemoglobin, PCV, platelet and red cell count were significantly lower among the pregnant subjects (10.7 \xc2\xb1 0.13 g/dl and 31.4 \xc2\xb1 0.38%, 252.7 \xc2\xb1 14.35 \xc3\x97 109/L and 3.7 \xc2\xb1 0.04) compared to the non-pregnant controls (12.2 \xc2\xb1 0.44 g/dl, 36.2 \xc2\xb1 1.17 %, 362.7 \xc2\xb1 36.51 \xc3\x97 109/L and 4.3 \xc2\xb1 0.11) (p= 0.004, 0.001, 0.009 and 0.000) respectively. There were no significant differences in the total white blood cell count between the pregnant subjects (5.3 \xc2\xb1 0.22) and non-pregnant controls (4.6 \xc2\xb1 0.59) (p= 0.267). The Neutrophils count was significantly higher among the pregnant subjects (42.6 \xc2\xb1 3.06) compared to the non-pregnant controls (20.0 \xc2\xb1 2.33) (p= 0.000). This study has shown that pregnancy has a significant effect on some haematological parameters of women of African descent. The results of this research work indicates the need to routinely monitor the full blood count, anaemia and thrombocytopenia among pregnant women of African descent.']

Alongside any strain relief of an affected joint, treatment with Iloprost also belongs to the choice of cures. In past studies, a modulatory effect on bone could be shown. The hypothesis of the present work is that Iloprost has a growth-stimulating effect on osteoblasts in vitro.   METHODS:  Human osteoblasts were isolated and cultivated. Subsequently, the cells were treated with Iloprost in bioavailable concentrations. Alterations of the cell structure were examined by means of light microscopy. A regulation of the number of vital cells was carried out by using a CASY cell counter. Possible cell impairment after Iloprost treatment was analysed by means of XTT Elisa as well as FDA and PI staining via fluorescence microscopy.   RESULTS:  Using light microscopy, no changes in cell structure could be observed. With the CASY cell counter, no increase in the numbers of osteoblasts appeared after Iloprost treatment. Also, XTT Elisas and fluorescence microscopy did not reveal any cell impairment due to Iloprost.   CONCLUSION:  Our results could not confirm a modulatory effect in mature osteoblasts. On the basis of the present work we could not verify any growth-stimulating effect by Iloprost in mature osteoblasts in vitro. Admittedly, effects had been shown previously during osteogenesis, but we do exclude an effect on mature osteoblasts which have already differentiated.']

This study aimed to examine the drivers, challenges, and opportunities of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and to identify new evidence for future policy making in Ethiopia.   METHOD:  A narrative review of the literature related to EMS was undertaken to describe the drivers, challenges, and opportunities for EMS in Ethiopia from July, 2000 to September, 2018. The search was done from four relevant electronic databases: MEDLINE, Science Directs, Scopus and PubMed by using Google Scholar and Google with key search words used mainly as \xe2\x80\x9cEmergency Medical services in Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x9d. The inclusion criteria were an original study or review studies involving Emergency Medical Services in Ethiopia. Among the available papers, the relevant articles were selected while the irrelevant ones were excluded.   RESULTS:  There was lack of trained emergency medical providers and misdistribution of trained professionals, immaturity of the program, lack of partnership and stakeholders and lack of motivation towards Emergency medical services. Emergency medical services hamper significant problems similar to other African countries that required being addressed in Ethiopia context for achieving the program and in order to obtain intended outcomes for the country.   CONCLUSION:  A long-term discussion is needed to further improve the services system in various health care facilities. An Emergency Medical services policy making and analysis framework is needed to make quality emergency medical care at Emergency department in hospitals and outside the hospitals.', b'2019-11-14', b'Ethiopia', b'challenges']

Despite the enormous number of inhabitants, these markets still lack a proper finance infrastructure. One of the main difficulties felt by customers is the access to loans. This limitation arises from the fact that most customers usually lack a verifiable credit history. As such, traditional banks are unable to provide loans. This paper proposes credit scoring modeling based on non-traditional-data, acquired from smartphones, for loan classification processes. We use Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models which are the top linear models in traditional banking. Then we compared the transformation of the training datasets creating boolean indicators against the categorization using Weight of Evidence (WoE). Our models surpassed the performance of the manual loan application selection process, improving the approval rate and decreasing the overdue rate. Compared to the baseline, the loans approved by meeting the criteria of the SVM model presented a decreased overdue rate. At the same time, using the score generated by a SVM model we were able to grant more loans. This paper shows that credit scoring can be useful in emerging markets.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 75 patients (60 males, 15 females, age 24\xe2\x80\x9384 years, mean 62.7 years) with 128 malignant liver lesions were included in this study. Between 01/2013 and 06/2018, the therapeutic interventional procedure in 88 lesions was MWA, in 40 lesions RFA. All patients underwent CEUS using a convex multifrequency probe (1\xe2\x80\x936 MHz) following application of 1\xe2\x80\x932.4 ml sulphur hexaflouride microbubbles, before and within 24 hours following RFA and MWA to detect residual tumor tissue.

RESULTS: In patients treated with RFA, pE differences between center of the lesion vs. surrounding liver were found to be statistically extremely significant (p < 0.001), differences between center of the lesion and margin were also statistically significant (p < 0.01). mTT, TTP, WiAuC and Ri showed no significant difference between center, margin or surrounding liver.

RESULTS: In patients treated with RFA, pE differences between center of the lesion vs. surrounding liver were found to be statistically extremely significant (p < 0.001), differences between center of the lesion and margin were also statistically significant (p < 0.01). mTT, TTP, WiAuC and Ri showed no significant difference between center, margin or surrounding liver.

Augmented reality intraoperative indocyanin green (ICG) lymphography-navigated modified \xe2\x80\x9csimplified lymphovenous anastomosis\xe2\x80\x9d were performed on the Leica microscope. All patients were informed about Off-label-use of ICG lymphography.   RESULTS: 57 LVAs were performed with modified \xe2\x80\x9csimplified lymphovenous anastomosis\xe2\x80\x9d lymphography-guidance on 30 upper extremities. All patients showed good patency after lymphovenous anastomosis.   CONCLUSIONS: Supermicrosurgery in the case of LVA is minimally invasive, highly effective, and shows a very low complication rate. The surgeon/equipment-related factors restrict the pratice of LVA, and its effectiveness limited by technical constraints.', b'augmented reality']

Globally and annually, at least 10 million individuals live with TBI that is serious enough to result in death or hospitalisation   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore and describe the experiences of women with traumatic brain injury, in their work environments utilising the Model of Occupational Self-efficacy as a vocational rehabilitation approach   METHOD: Ten females with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury participated in the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and data were analysed utilising a qualitative approach to elucidate themes. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with two occupational therapists who served as key informants.   RESULTS: Two themes emerged depicting the participants\xe2\x80\x99 experiences and perceptions of barriers and facilitators which influenced their return to work: (1) Barriers to work participation for women with TBI, 2) Re-establishing a worker identity by means of vocational rehabilitation.   CONCLUSION: Both personal and environmental factors emerged as hindrances to returning to work for women with traumatic brain injury. Vocational rehabilitation proved successful in establishing a worker identity amongst participants; however, particular focus should be placed on the function-dysfunction continuum of the process of work place integration to further develop and enhance sustainable return to work programmes for women with traumatic brain injury.']

OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this study was to compare the serum albumin, ESR, and C-reactive protein levels in follicular and luteal phases of menstruation.   METHODS:  A total of 90 healthy regularly menstruating women where used for this study. Forty-five of the study participants were in their follicular phase while the other 45 where in their luteal phase. Four milliliters of blood were withdrawn from each patient under aseptic condition and two milliliters was dispensed into EDTA container while the other two milliliters were dispensed into a plane container. The EDTA anticoagulated blood was used for ESR and full blood count while the serum from the plain tubes was used for analysis of C-reactive protein and Serum Albumin.

Although white matter hyperintensities (WMH) as expressions of cerebral small vessel disease are associated with physical and cognitive decline and could manifest as CF, this association remains yet to be clarified.   Objects: To clarify the association between CF and WMH among memory clinic patients.   Methods: The subjects of this cross-sectional study were 121 cognitively normal (CN) and 212 mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) patients who presented to the Memory Clinic at the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology of Japan. PF status was defined based on the definition proposed by Fried and colleagues. CF was defined as simultaneous presence of pre-PF or PF and MCI. WMH volumes were measured using an automatic segmentation application. Multiple liner regression analyses with adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors were performed.   Results: Of all subjects, 77 (63.6%) and 22 (18.2%) CN patients and 132 (62.3%) and 65 (30.7%) MCI patients were categorized into pre-PF and PF, respectively. Multiple liner regression analysis showed that those with CF had higher WMH volumes than those without (\xce\xb2= 0.23). When categorized into six groups according to PF and cognitive status, the PF/CN (\xce\xb2= 0.15), pre-PF/MCI (\xce\xb2= 0.41), and PF/MCI (\xce\xb2= 0.34) groups had higher WMH volumes than the non-PF/CN group.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to examine musculoskeletal symptoms in cleaners of different heights to evaluate the effects of height on working postures in the work environment (schools).   METHODS: We used a three-stage method including using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) to evaluate musculoskeletal symptoms, a task analysis to confirm typical cleaning tasks, and the OVAKO Working Posture Assessment System (OWAS) for posture analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to evaluate the adjusted effects of individual characteristics on painful body regions, using individuals without any pain as the reference category.   RESULTS: This study found that the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms is very high for cleaners, especially in the shoulders, elbows, and lower back. Odds ratios for the accumulation of two or more risk factors were higher among men and were inversely associated with national economic indicators. The relatively high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms may stem from the multiple operations involved in cleaning tasks, such as trash collecting, floor mopping, toilet cleaning, and mirror polishing. Workers of different heights had differential work loadings for different tasks.   CONCLUSIONS: This paper proposes recommendations for job adaptations and occupational safety training. Cleaners of different heights execute the typical tasks via different postures, and awkward postures often result in musculoskeletal symptoms. Cleaners should be provided with specific tools and training regarding working postures on the basis of height.

Although, swimming is a popular sport throughout the world, studies on the effects of warm-up are scarce.   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of different stretching warm-up and exercise protocols on swim performance.   METHODS:  Fourteen sub-elite college women swimmers volunteered to participate in the study. The four stretching and warm-up protocols they followed were; (I) without stretching (WS); (II) static stretch (SS); (III) in-water (IW); and (IV) dry land (DL).   RESULTS: There was a significant main effect for 50-meter front crawl (F = 70,453; p= 0.00) and breaststroke swimming performances (F = 145.504; p= 0.000). The best 50-meter front crawl and breaststroke performance detected immediately after IW was 28.1 and next, 39.9 seconds.

Some studies showed that miRNAs were used as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers for various diseases.   OBJECTIVE:  To identify candidate miRNAs in Granulosa Cells (GCs) of PCOS and evaluate their potential values for PCOS diagnosis.   METHODS:  We screened differentially expressed miRNAs in GCs between PCOS and controls by the microarray data from the GEO database. GCs were collected from 21 controls and 24 PCOS. The candidate miRNAs were verified by qRT-PCR. The correlation was investigated between candidate miRNAs and clinical characteristics in participants. Diagnostic value of candidate miRNAs was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.   RESULTS:  Seven miRNAs were differentially expressed in PCOS compared with controls. Furthermore, the validation results demonstrated that hsa-miR-3188 and hsa-miR-3135b showed higher levels in GCs with PCOS patients (p< 0.05). In addition, the expressions of hsa-miR-3188 and hsa-miR-3135b were negative correlated with FSH and hsa-miR-3188 was positive correlated with BMI (p< 0.05). ROC analysis indicated that hsa-miR-3188 and hsa-miR-3135b could differentiate PCOS from controls, and the hsa-miR-3188/3135b improved the predictive accuracy for PCOS.   CONCLUSIONS:  The expressions of hsa-miR-3188 and hsa-miR-3135b in human GCs were significantly associated with PCOS.

However, follow up after FT is still challenging and is subject to current studies. Significance of imaging after FT such as multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is currently not well established. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of alternative imaging during the follow up of low risk PCa treated with focal HIFU therapy using CEUS and image fusion.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective single arm study in patients with uni- or bilateral, low or intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with HIFU at our institution between October 2016 and January 2018. CEUS in combination with image fusion using an axial T2-weighted MRI sequence was performed during follow up 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the therapy.   RESULTS: 4 consecutive patients with Gleason score (GS) 6 and 4 patients with GS 7a prostate cancer were included in the study. Hemiablation was performed in 7 patients with unilateral tumor. One patient underwent whole gland treatment due to histological proven bilateral PCa. Mean patient age at time of therapy was 70.3 (54\xe2\x80\x9383) years and mean Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level prior treatment was 7.8 ng/ml (2.1\xe2\x80\x9314.4), after 3 months mean PSA level was 3.9 ng/ml (0.1\xe2\x80\x937.2), after 6 months 3.5 ng/ml (0.2\xe2\x80\x936.0), after 9 months 3.1 ng/ml (0.2\xe2\x80\x936.8) and 3.3 ng/ml (0.2\xe2\x80\x936.1) after 12 months. CEUS showed no signs of microvascularisation after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in the ablated zone. 3 months posttreatment the necrotic tissue was still visible in the B-mode scan, although with no signs of vascularization performing CEUS. After 6 months the ablated side of the prostate was almost completely atrophic. And after 9 months the necrotic tissue was completely resolved. Between 9 and 12 months no changes in microvascularisation and perfusion could be shown.   CONCLUSIONS: MpMRI/CEUS image fusion is a cost-effective and feasible technique to monitor the perfusion of the ablation zone after focal therapy of the prostate.']

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of alternative imaging during the follow up of low risk PCa treated with focal HIFU therapy using CEUS and image fusion.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective single arm study in patients with uni- or bilateral, low or intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with HIFU at our institution between October 2016 and January 2018. CEUS in combination with image fusion using an axial T2-weighted MRI sequence was performed during follow up 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the therapy.   RESULTS: 4 consecutive patients with Gleason score (GS) 6 and 4 patients with GS 7a prostate cancer were included in the study. Hemiablation was performed in 7 patients with unilateral tumor. One patient underwent whole gland treatment due to histological proven bilateral PCa. Mean patient age at time of therapy was 70.3 (54\xe2\x80\x9383) years and mean Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level prior treatment was 7.8 ng/ml (2.1\xe2\x80\x9314.4), after 3 months mean PSA level was 3.9 ng/ml (0.1\xe2\x80\x937.2), after 6 months 3.5 ng/ml (0.2\xe2\x80\x936.0), after 9 months 3.1 ng/ml (0.2\xe2\x80\x936.8) and 3.3 ng/ml (0.2\xe2\x80\x936.1) after 12 months. CEUS showed no signs of microvascularisation after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in the ablated zone. 3 months posttreatment the necrotic tissue was still visible in the B-mode scan, although with no signs of vascularization performing CEUS. After 6 months the ablated side of the prostate was almost completely atrophic. And after 9 months the necrotic tissue was completely resolved. Between 9 and 12 months no changes in microvascularisation and perfusion could be shown.   CONCLUSIONS: MpMRI/CEUS image fusion is a cost-effective and feasible technique to monitor the perfusion of the ablation zone after focal therapy of the prostate.']

Taking a perspective in harmony with an approach more characteristic of human thinking, in which complex problems are solved hierarchically, we propose a two-level hierarchical granularity model for this problem. The first level of the proposed model is a coarse-grained layer, in which the original dataset is divided into groups. The second level is a fine-grained layer, where problems are solved in each group instead of on the original dataset, which reduces complexity and computation while improving efficiency. On the basis of this hierarchical model, we propose the interpolation trajectory-anonymous privacy protection algorithm with temporal and spatial granularity constraints. In addition, we propose interpolation-based modified Hausdorff distance on adjacent segment (IMHD_AS), which provides a smaller clustering area and better data utility than the traditional Euclidean distance, as the trajectory similarity criterion for clustering within each group. Further, we theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional algorithm in terms of data distortion and anonymity cost and verify its efficacy experimentally. Compared with the classic anonymity algorithm, the maximum information loss and the anonymity cost are reduced by up to 21.04% and 28.32%, respectively.', b'interpolation points', b'trajectory privacy protection', b'2019-11-07']

Therefore, identifying the factors that affect the formability of Mg alloy is highly important. In this study, forming limits of Mg alloy sheet under electromagnetic forming (EMF) condition were analyzed at different temperatures based on the Johnson\xe2\x80\x93Cook constitutive model and the failure model. The complete forming limit diagrams of AZ31 Mg alloy at different temperatures and high strain rates were established.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and effectiveness of a 2-week CIMT protocol on upper limb activity of progressive MS patients through a three-dimensional (3D) kinematic analysis.   METHODS: In this randomized single-blind pilot study, we randomly allocated patients affected by progressive MS reporting a reduced use of one upper limb into two different groups: CIMT group (less affected limb blocked by a splint) and control group (undergoing bi-manual treatment). Primary outcome was CIMT safety. Furthermore, we assessed CIMT effects through clinical outcomes (hand grip strength, HGS, and 9 Hole Peg Test, 9HPT) and 3D kinematic analysis (normalized jerk, number of movement units, going phase duration, mean velocity, endpoint error). All evaluations were performed at baseline (T0) and after 2 weeks of treatment (T1) for both arms in both groups.   RESULTS: Ten MS patients, mean aged 51.0\xc2\xb17.7 years, were randomly allocated in the 2 groups. After treatment, no differences were found in the blocked arm. Furthermore, CIMT group showed significant improvements in clinical and kinematic parameters.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate if the effects of the combination of NW to CE are superior to isolated techniques in the rehabilitation of balance, gait, functional mobility and improvement of the quality of life of individuals with PD.   METHODS: 45 patients with PD were divided into three groups, NW alone, CE alone and NW plus EC. The sessions occurred for 50 minutes, twice a week and evaluations administered before and after the 2-month intervention.   RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the pre and post intervention analyzes of all the outcomes in the three groups, but there was no difference between the groups. The effect size was evaluated, in which the NW plus CE group had a greater magnitude of the therapeutic effect.   CONCLUSION: The NW plus CE was statistically as effective as each intervention alone in the rehabilitation of patients with PD, however, the use of this combination provided a magnitude of the therapeutic effect superior to the other groups.']

METHODS: A grounded theory study design was used to collect and analyse interview data from 23 employers and 22 rehabilitation professionals.

Moreover, the overhang effect was investigated for different overhang structures. Because the AFPM motor has an enlarged form along radial direction, the leakage flux and the saturation effect are considerably different at inner and outer radius of the stator. Therefore, inner and outer overhang part could have different overhang effects. This can lead to the optimization problem with optimal overhang length. Because the AFPM motor requires 3D finite element analysis from its 3D structure, an efficient optimization algorithm is required for optimal overhang structure. In order to increase the convergence speed of the optimization algorithm, this paper proposed the gradient assisted contour method.', b'finite element method', b'undefined', b'overhang structure']

Existing field or laboratory studies showed that standing interventions are not a detriment to work productivity or performance. The effect of gradient standing proportion on these measures is still unknown.   OBJECTIVE: The current naturalistic pilot study aimed to examine the controlled sit-stand ratio effect on office performances.   METHODS: Eleven musculoskeletal symptom free office employees from a large government agency volunteered in this study. They were all equipped with electronic sit-stand desks. Computer usage (N=11) and productivity (N=3) were collected using software and organizational metrics, respectively, for four typical workdays of four different sit-stand ratios (7 : 1, 3 : 1, 2 : 1, and 1 : 1).   RESULTS: There were no statistically significant schedule effects on any computer usage measures. While not significant, time using computer, keystrokes, word count, and keyboard errors were all less as standing time increased. Sit-stand ratio and job productivity did not observe a clear cause and effect relationship.   CONCLUSIONS: The amount of time spent standing in typical office jobs might not affect computer usage and productivity. Further study with a larger sample is needed for a stronger evidence.', b'Office ergonomics']

Objective: We evaluated whether recognition memory and associated indices, including discriminability and response bias from signal detection theory, differentiate persons with amnestic MCI (aMCI) due to prodromal AD from non-prodromal AD.   Method: Sixty older adults with aMCI were classified as prodromal AD (n = 28) or non-prodromal AD (n = 32) based upon cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-\xce\xb2 and tau.

Previous work has shown that vibration that results from increased flow velocity around the catheter can have a cooling effect on the electrode.   OBJECTIVE:  Contact force has been shown to be an important factor that affects cooling and lesion formation, because contact force determines the ratio of power delivery between blood and tissue. In this study, the effect of contact force on electrode cooling and tissue heating was investigated during the operation of an electrode cooled by vibration.   METHODS:  Using PVA-H or myocardium ablation tissue models under conditions of no flow, electrode and tissue temperatures and lesion sizes were measured at various vibrational frequencies and contact force conditions.   RESULTS:  The experiments showed that the catheter vibration still decreases the electrode temperature over a contact force range of 2\xe2\x80\x9330 gf. The lesion size was increased with increasing contact force at each vibrational frequency.   CONCLUSIONS:  Increasing contact force can increase lesion size with cooling by vibration remaining effective.', b'contact force', b'electrode cooling']

METHODS: This study includes a complete data set of 26 patients who received LVA for a therapy-resistant lymphedema. Patients were followed up for an average of 23 months.

First, the concept of the free-boundary equilibrium problem is studied. Based on the non-rigid plasma model, a free-boundary equilibrium solver developed in MATLAB software is presented to calculate the flux distribution and plasma profile of EAST plasma equilibrium, and the results are validated against the experiments. Second, given a typical double-null plasma equilibrium, the responses of plasma shape to the lower PF coil currents are computed using the orthogonal test method. The dependences of the elongation and triangularity of plasma shape on PF coil currents are obtained, showing that the currents in PF6 and PF8 have the greatest impact on triangularity and elongation for lower single-null (LSN) divertor configuration, respectively. And for double-null (DN) divertor plasma configuration, PF5 and PF7 play equally important roles due to the up-down symmetry. The conclusions will be useful for the design of EAST plasma shape feedback control.', b'Impact of poloidal field coil current disturbance on tokamak plasma shape', b'orthogonal test method', b'free-boundary equilibrium calculation', b'plasma shape response']

Methods: In this study, the migration of endothelial cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes in conjunction with platelet-rich plasma treatment is investigated in the context of radiation effects. Additionally, cell proliferation and viability after external radiation was analyzed regarding treatment by platelet-rich plasma.   RESULTS: All cell cultures showed a trend towards decreasing proliferation and viability after irradiation irrespective of PRP. Upon PRP treatment, irradiated fibroblasts as well as endothelial cells showed an enhanced proliferation whereas proliferation and viability of keratinocytes was reduced after PRP treatment. Scratch assays support the positive effect of PRP on fibroblast and endothelial cell migration, whereas a negative effect on keratinocytes was observed after PRP treatment.   CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents both deleterious effects of external radiation as well as the protective effect of PRP. In summary, increased viability, proliferation and migration are indeed a consequence of the pro-proliferative effect exerted by PRP.

However, most predictive models do not capture environmental exposures that impact health risk patterns in several chronic diseases such as asthma. This gap prompted the development of the exposome paradigm to improve health intervention and prevention by providing meaningful and understandable feedback on individuals\xe2\x80\x99 collected data and minimizing their exposures to health risks. The exposome paradigm focuses on the simultaneous monitoring of mobility behaviors and measurement of environmental conditions to capture their impact on human health. In this paper, we introduce the concept of exposome analytics that compliments predictive analytics to develop an effective health monitoring and management system. We present the current analytical developments including our ongoing project to manage risks of asthma exacerbations as a case study. Our proposed approach uses a novel exposome assessment paradigm that utilizes the spatio-temporal properties of the data in the model training process and hence results in improving the accuracy of asthma prediction. The quality of the proposed approach is extensively evaluated using real patients and environmental datasets.', b'asthma risk management', b'Exposome', b'classification', b'individual-level health analytics', b'predictive health analytics', b'quantile regression', b'2019-11-18', b'logistic regression']

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of balance taping on PFPS.   METHODS: Balance taping using kinesiology tape was applied for 2.5 months (average of 16 h/day) to both knees in a 26-year-old female nurse with bilateral PFPS.   RESULTS:  The congruence angle decreased in the right and left knees from 30\xe2\x88\x98 to 5\xe2\x88\x98 and from 20\xe2\x88\x98 to 5\xe2\x88\x98, respectively. The Patient Specific Functional Scale score increased from 17/50 to 50/50, indicating improved functional state of the knees, while the Numeric Pain Rating Scale scores for from sitting to standing, from standing to sitting, and kneeling improved from 6/10 and 0/10, indicating no pain in the knee joints. Application of repeated balance taping for 2.5 months reduced PFPS.   CONCLUSION: Considering the outcome of the study, we recommend balance taping as a complementary treatment method for PFPS.', b'complementary treatment', b'Effects of balance taping using kinesiology tape in a female with patellofemoral pain syndrome: A case report', b'congruence angle', b'Balance taping', b'PFPS', b'2019-11-10']

OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at gaining knowledge about the micromorphology of the femoral artery (FA) from German Landrace pigs (DL) and GM during the period of growth over a body weight range of 10\xe2\x80\x9340 kg.   METHODS: FA samples from DL aged two or three months were compared to GM ones, aged 18 or 40 months using transmitted light microscopy.   RESULTS: All FA samples showed typical characteristics of muscular arteries. Growth was associated with increased vessel wall thickness. In the GM this resulted in a slight decrease of the luminal diameter (LD), while in the DL pigs, an increase of the LD and smooth muscle cell content (10%) with decreased elastic fiber content (10%) has been detected. In contrast, within the 22 months lasting growth period of the GM, the tunica media content of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers remained stable.

OBJECTIVE:  This research was conducted to determine the status of full blood count, zinc and manganese levels among Diabetic patients attending Specialist Hospital, Sokoto.   METHODS:  The participants were divided into two groups; 58 diabetic subjects and 29 non-diabetic controls. Five milliliters of blood were collected into EDTA and plain containers for full blood count, serum zinc and manganese analysis. The FBC investigation was carried out using automated Mythic Haematology analyzer (Orphee, Switzerland) while Zn and Mn investigations were carried out using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). The FBC, Zn and Mn status of both control and subjects were compared statistically.   RESULTS:  The results obtained in this study showed a significant increase in RBC, PCV, Hb, Basophils, Eosinophil, Lymphocyte count and Manganese levels of diabetic subjects (p\xe2\xa9\xbd 0.05) when compared with controls.

Objective: We proposed an automatic, non-invasive, and quick MCI detection approach based on multimodal physiological signals for clinical decision-marking.   Methods: The proposed model recruited 152 patients with MCI and 184 healthy elderly controls (HC) who underwent EEG and eye movement signal recording under a visual stimuli task, as well as other neuropsychological assessments. Forty features were extracted from EEG and eye movement signals by linear and nonlinear analysis. The features related to MCI were selected by logistic regression analysis. To evaluate the efficacy of this MCI detection approach, we applied the same procedures to achieve the Clinical model, EEG model, Eye movement model, EEG+ Clinical model, Eye movement+ Clinical model, and Combined model, and compared the classification accuracy between the MCI and HC groups with the above six models.   Results: After the penalization of logistic regression analysis, five features from EEG and eye movement features exhibited significant differences (p < 0.05). In the classification experiment, the combined model resulted in the best accuracy. The average accuracy for the Clinical/EEG/Eye movement/EEG+ Clinical/Eye movement+ Clinical/Combined model was 68.69%, 61.79%, 73.13%, 69.46%, 75.61%, and 81.51%, respectively.

In this paper, we propose two computational formulae for similarity measures on IFSs based on a quaternary function called intuitionistic fuzzy equivalence. We first propose the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy equivalence. Then we give a computational formula for intuitionistic fuzzy equivalencies (i.e., Eq. (1)), which is obtained from combining dissimilarity functions and fuzzy equivalencies. Based on Eq. (1), we obtain two computational formulae for similarity measures on IFSs. The first one is obtained by aggregating Eq. (1). The second one is obtained by respectively aggregating the numerator and the denominator of Eq. (1). We also examine some properties of the proposed similarity measures on IFSs. Finally, we make a comparison between the proposed similarity measures on IFSs and those existing ones in the literature through several counter-intuitive cases.', b'Fuzzy equivalencies', b'Similarity measures', b'Intuitionistic fuzzy sets', b'Dissimilarity functions', b'Intuitionistic fuzzy equivalencies']

The data collections were conducted at two selected districts in Afar region by trained interviewers and health care providers. The data were analyzed by using SPSS Version 23. Bivariate analysis between dependent and independent variables was employed. Multivariate analysis was also done to control for possible confounding variable by selecting variable which show statistically significant association (P< 0.05).   RESULTS:  Out of 410 under five children\xe2\x80\x99s anthropometric finding, the majorities (62.7%) of those registered under five children were male and (33.3%) were female. The majority (46.8%) of under five children were less than or equal to 50 cm by their height. Most (54.1%) of under five children were less than or equal to 12.5 cm by their MUAC. It indicated that they were diagnosed with severe malnutrition based on anthropometric measurements. Meanwhile, majority (64%) of under five children were less than 60% their weight/age. Regression analysis result indicated that all of the variables were not significant predictors of BMI for under five children (P> 0.05). Based on ANOVA result, there was significant difference between sex and other predictors (P= 0.031). This finding implies that improvement in food aid and poverty alleviation programs are very important. Based on the finding, it is important to provide high quality and quantity of food. Moreover, less access to assets and health services commonly contributed for malnutrition.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 27 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma examined by a standardized protocol (bolus injection of 2.4 ml sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles, arterial phase to portal venous phase using continuous CINE-loops over 1 minute, short CINE-loops after 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes and additional single images for B-mode, CCDS). The examination was performed by an experienced sonographer with a high resolution, multi-frequency transducer (1\xe2\x80\x936 MHz). The reading of the reference imaging (contrast enhanced CT and MRI) and histopathology, if necessary, was performed independently. Retrospective analysis of the CEUS DICOM loops was done using time intensity curve analysis (TIC) with evaluation of the time to peak (TTP) and the area under the curve (AUC).

Consequently, NCDs are becoming an increasingly important public health problem in the country. Furthermore, the country has faced a high level of food insecurity.   METHODS:  We conducted a comprehensive review based on published articles from 2010 to 2018 and WHO reports on food insecurity, malnutrition and their impacts on the burden of NCDs death in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the seriousness of the NCDs cause of deaths in relation to food insecurity and malnutrition. In addition, policy for protecting vulnerability and the implementation of SDGs on food insecurity, malnutrition, and NCDs were also discussed. The results of this review highlight the progress that was made in the overall condition of food insecurity, nutrition, and diseases in the country.   RESULTS:  The finding shows that there has been large burden of recurrent food insecurity, which could be due to malnutrition that might be associated to inconsistent rainfall distribution and also the experience of violent conflict in recent periods. However, the prevalence of undernourishment was declined from 75% in 1990s to 32% in 2015 though the numbers indicate a marginal reduction. But unexpectedly still the child mortality rate of under-five that results from malnutrition accounts about 57% of all children deaths. As the result of malnutrition, obesity is recognized as the determinants for a number of NCDs such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Communicable diseases seems the only identified health problem in the country, however; the burden of NCDs is facing major aspects. Hence, NCDs like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, currently, are among the leading causes of death among adults, which is responsible for 39% of deaths in the country in 2015 while the risk of premature NCDs mortality was reached about 15.2%. Of these deaths, 4% was due to cancer and 9% was related to other NCDs such as obesity and nutrition-related cases. Therefore, food insecurity has a high-flying impact in early death from chronic health conditions and the cause of undernutrition that leads to an augmented susceptibility and decreased flexibility to NCDs as a result of compromised nutrition.   CONCLUSION:  In order to sustain the economic growth, reduce poverty and achieving food security, the Ethiopian government has started discourse at high level of agenda hoping to avoid recurrent violent conflict, food insecurity and famine by targeting urban low-income households and empowering youth and women.', b'2019-11-14', b'Impact of food insecurity and malnutrition on the burden of Non-communicable diseases and death in Ethiopia: A situational analysis']

This calculation process normally requires a high computation time and its reduction is always a desirable goal. Circulating currents in parallel connected conductors in transformer windings are a critical design aspect to be analyzed. This article presents a new methodology for the fast calculation of circulating currents for parallel connected conductors in power transformers. The formulation for solid conductor modeling has been developed using the same calculation strategy as in Semianalytic Integral Method (SAIM) [1], which allows a significant reduction of computational effort. A realistic case study of a 25 MVA transformer was used to validate the proposed methodology. As for the accuracy of the calculations, the comparison of the results obtained by the proposed methodology and those calculated using the Finite Element Method (FEM) shows an excellent agreement between both approaches. However, the computational performance of the new approach was found to be much higher than that of FEM. This makes the proposed method much more efficient for transformer design purposes.', b'undefined', b'power transformers', b'Circulating currents', b'skin depth', b'integral methods', b'Semianalytic integral method for the fast solution of circulating currents in power transformers']

Objective: This study aimed to explore the prevalence of cases with AD-related pathology in subjects <40 years of age and to explore the association of such pathology, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and APOE genotype.   Method: We conducted brain immunohistochemistry for 189 cases <40 years of age (mean\xc2\xb1standard deviation age 25.3\xc2\xb113.1 years). Tau positive cases were then assessed for the distribution of tau pathology in the locus ceruleus (LC), raphe nucleus (RN), and entorhinal cortex (ErC), and the distinction between neuronal threads and cellular inclusions. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype was also examined.   Results: Tau pathology was detected in 135 cases (71.4%; 13\xe2\x80\x9339 years; only LC, 23 cases; only RN, 4 cases; only ErC, 35 cases; LC+RN, 3 cases; LC+ErC, 57 cases; all three regions, 10 cases). The prevalence of thread pathology was higher than that of cellular inclusions. Significantly higher prevalence of the APOE \xc9\x9b2 allele were found in 10\xe2\x80\x9339 years of age natural death cases (p < 0.05). Amyloid-\xce\xb2 deposition was found in only 7 cases, along with a significantly high frequency of the \xc9\x9b4 allele (p < 0.05). While a past history of psychiatric disease was a significant risk factor for suicide, AD-related pathology was not associated with suicide.   Conclusions: Both the brain stem and entorhinal cortex was the initial site of tau pathology in many younger subjects. AD-related pathology may not be a significant accelerating factor for suicide in younger subjects.', b'tau', b'neuropathology']

The aim of study was to present the point of views, prospect and priorities of Emergency medical services case teams and its coordinator along some main dimensions of emergency medical services, such as Leadership, Motivation, Structure, and Assurance for implementation.   METHODS:  Six focus group discussion were facilitated with EMS case teams, focal persons and FMoH emergency medical services case teams from December to August, 2017 in all regions chosen of the study. The focus group techniques were used in the study as qualitative research method for examination of viewpoints of case team members towards to the emergency medical care system and overall pre-hospital and at hospital emergency care services. The discussion was addressing the topics of: general aspects of emergency Medical Services (EMS) and which occupations included in EMS; possibilities to importance review EMS issues based on Leadership, Motivation, Structure, and Assurance for implementation of EMS in the country. Finally, thematic analysis was used to evaluate data sets which collected during the focus group discussion.   RESULTS:  There were 6 focus groups in total: an Emergency medical services case teams, officers, Directorates, and integrated disease prevention and control program coordinators groups in each of the regional, city Administration Health Bureau and Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia. Findings of the thematic analysis were summarized along the following dimensions: Leadership, Motivation, Structure, and Assurance for implementation. The result shown that lack of resources, shortage of training, lack of professionals and community awareness on EMS, immaturity of EMS strategic plan and lack of revision, workload as a result of limited skilled manpower, lack of partnerships and collaboration on EMS and lack of research and community services evidence are among factors affecting the quality EMS and continuity of the program at various health care facilities at the regional and national levels.

OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of high intensity laser therapy (HILT) on pain and function in patients with spinal disorders.   METHODS:  Six databases were searched up to the end of February 2018 including PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Open Grey and Grey Literature Report. In addition, the reference lists of all included studies were searched for any relevant studies. PEDro scale and GRADE system were performed to assess the quality of the studies. A meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the overall effect size.   RESULTS:  A total of ten randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria, with four studies of the efficacy of HILT on neck pain (NP) and six on low back pain (LBP). According to the PEDro scale assessment, only two studies were rated as high quality, while the remainder were rated as fair or low quality. Forest plots showed that HILT with exercise was significantly more effective than placebo HILT with exercise in terms of pain reduction (SMD -1.11; 95% CI -1.42 to -0.80; P< 0.00001; I2 0%) and functional improvement (SMD -1.03; 95% CI -1.33 to -0.72; P< 0.00001; I2 0%). Meta-analyses also showed that HILT alone or HILT with conventional physiotherapy (CPT) significantly provided better outcomes than CPT alone.   CONCLUSIONS:  HILT is considered as a complementary modality for pain reduction and function improvement in patients with spinal disorders. However, the quality of the body of evidence was rated from \xe2\x80\x98very low\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98low\xe2\x80\x99 quality. Further high quality trials are required for standardisation of irradiation parameters and the treatment protocol to establish the efficacy of HILT for spinal disorders.', b'2019-11-10', b'High intensity laser therapy', b'low back pain', b'The effectiveness of high intensity laser therapy in the management of spinal disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis', b'neck pain', b'spinal disorders', b'rehabilitation']

Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine response rates and survival outcomes on patients with mUC progressing despite prior platinum-based chemotherapy receiving ICI stratified by biomarker status.   Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search for all articles in PubMed and Embase up to 06/15/2019 to identify all studies pertaining to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor targeted therapies for mUC that reported biomarkers. Given that biomarkers are reported on different scales and with different metrics, we defined each biomarker as either positive or negative using the definitions implemented in each individual trial. We meta-analyzed the data, reconstructed overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) curves, and analyzed response rates by biomarker status. OS and PFS were analyzed in a pooled Kaplan-Meier analysis and pseudo-individualized patient data (IPD) extracted.   Results: We identified 1429 manuscripts of which 8 met inclusion criteria, with a total of 1837 treated patients with outcomes data. On proportional hazards survival analysis, patients in the biomarker negative group were associated with a lower PFS (HR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.85, p < 0.001) and lower OS (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.32 - 1.80, p < 0.001) when compared to the biomarker positive group. Response data was available for 1641 patients and random effects proportion show complete response in 8% and 3% in biomarker positive and negative patients, respectively.   Conclusions: ICI therapy for metastatic UC post platinum therapy has a higher overall response rate, OS and PFS in patients who are biomarker positive compared to those who are negative. However, some patients who are biomarker negative do achieve complete responses. A better biomarker for patient selection is essential before biomarkers can be used to stratify candidates for ICI therapy.', b'B7-H1']

Secondly, the combination of jDE and GOA greatly improves the convergence efficiency while maintaining the population diversity. Finally, it can be observed in the work that the proposed algorithm improves the convergence speed and calculation precision. In the subsequent experiments, 14 well-known test benchmark functions are used to compare the advantages of GOA_jDE. The experimental results illustrate that the performance of proposed algorithm has significant improvement, which also proves the feasibility and effectiveness. Considering the complexity of engineering problems, three classical engineering design problems (tension/compression spring, welded beam, and pressure vessel designs) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the classical engineering design results proves the merits of this algorithm in solving real problems with unknown search spaces.']

In order to investigate the general performance of the proposed HBGEPSO algorithm, the proposed algorithm is compared with the original optimizers and other optimizers that have been used for FS in the past.

First, some concepts of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set are introduced. Then, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy superiority and inferiority ranking (IVIF-SIR) method is developed.

It is an inexpensive and sensitive tool in hands of a trained operator. All AUS negative patients undergo Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB), while AUS positive patients bypass SLNB and undergo axillary nodal clearance (ANC) as a standard protocol. We wish to analyse these two groups to see if ANC can be foregone in these patients.   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To compare and analyse the axillary disease burden in early breast cancer patients, with positive axilla, detected by AUS+ Biopsy versus those patients with normal axillary ultrasound or negative axillary biopsy that underwent ANC due to positive SLNB.   MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent axillary lymph node clearance following histologically confirmed positive ultrasound (US) axilla (year 2009\xe2\x80\x932014) was performed and was compared with data collected for patients with USG negative but SLNB (OSNA- One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) positive axilla.   RESULTS: Axillary clearances performed for positive US axilla yielded significantly more positive lymph nodes than SLNB/OSNA positive axilla (p = 0.00496). These patients also had larger primary tumours (median 33 mm versus 21 mm, p = 0.01242) of a higher grade. Almost half of the patients in AUS positive group (49%) had high axillary nodal burden (>4 LNs). This is in great contrast with AUS negative, SLNB/OSNA positive group where 82.7% of patients had <4 positive nodes with more than half patients (51.7%) having no further positive nodes in their final histopathology specimen.   CONCLUSIONS: ANC should be a standard protocol in AUS positive patients as they invariably have high axillary disease burden while ANC can be omitted in case of select AUS negative and SLNB patients. However, further studies with more subjects may be require to substantiate the findings.', b'AUS (Axillary ultrasound)', b'ANC (Axillary Nodal Clearance)', b'SLNB (Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy)']

However, not too much attention has been paid to expert clustering in the LGDM problem under a linguistic environment. Besides, it seems that only the decision information is utilized to group experts while the auxiliary (outside) knowledge (e.g., expertise and occupation) about these experts has not been fully considered during the clustering process. To address this issue, this study proposes a hybrid method integrating outside knowledge about experts with practical preference information under the interval-valued linguistic environment to cluster experts. The method consists of four elements: pre-clustering of experts according to the given knowledge, the optimization model to transform the interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic (IV2TL) decision information, the data envelopment analysis-discriminant analysis (DEA-DA) model to deal with a two-cluster issue, and iterative clustering based on the DEA-DA model to cluster experts into multiple clusters. The feasibility and validity of the proposed method are illustrated with a real-world example. A comparison with the maximal tree clustering method in the linguistic environment is provided.', b'Clustering experts in linguistic environment: A hybrid method', b'outside knowledge', b'expert clustering']

By introducing computer technology to analyze the efficiency and regularity of sports, not only the characteristics of athletes can be excavated, but also the visibility and dynamic tracking of sport training can be provided. The process of sports education is a fast and complex systematic process. Through the interactive system of physical education, we can use different methods to collect sports data and make a comparative analysis of athletes\xe2\x80\x99 movements. Through the data mining of the relationship between athletes\xe2\x80\x99 physiological indexes and sports load, the unreasonable link in sports training can be avoided. Also, in sports training, we can use computer vision and modern biomechanics to construct a virtual sports education situation. With the classification accuracy as the fitness function, this paper collects the data through the network database, and returns the corresponding sport training parameters on this basis. The results showed that the accuracy of the model was nearly 98%, which met the actual demand. Therefore, the development of sports education assistant system can provide strong support for the process control of sports training and education.']

The activity of petroleum ether, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate and methanol extract of algae belonging to Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta were examined against pathogenic bacteria. The crude extract of algae evoked several patterns of antibacterial activities. The petroleum ether extract of Gracilaria multipartita, Ulva reticulata and Sargassum marginatum collected in spring recorded the maximum inhibitory activity against Bacillus subtilis (14\xe2\x80\x9325 mm), MRSA (24\xe2\x80\x9335 mm) and Staphylococcus aureus (14\xe2\x80\x9318 mm), respectively. However, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae were highly inhibited by petroleum ether extract of G. multipartita collected in spring (17\xe2\x80\x9324 mm and 15\xe2\x80\x9319 mm, respectively). Pseudomonas aeruginosa recorded the greatest zone of inhibition (18\xe2\x80\x9322 mm) by the petroleum ether extract of S. marginatum gathered during winter. The MICs values for bacteria were ranged between 1.00\xe2\x80\x932.75 \xce\xbcg/ml. The chemical composition of the most effective algae extract against pathogenic bacteria was performed by GC-MS and 1H-NMR analysis.

Serious game characteristics (target position, level of assistance/resistance, level of force) are typically adapted based on the child\xe2\x80\x99s assessment before and continuously during the game (measuring UL working area, kinematics and muscle strength).   OBJECTIVE: This study developed an UL robotic motor assessment protocol to configure the serious game.   METHODS: Forty-nine healthy children and 20 CP children participated in the study. The clinical assessment consisted of the child\xe2\x80\x99s UL length and isometric force. The robot assessment consisted of the child\xe2\x80\x99s UL working area (WA), the UL isometric and isokinetic force in three directions and the UL kinematics during a pointing task toward targets placed at different distances.   RESULTS: Results showed that WA and UL isometric force were moderately to highly correlated with clinical measures. Ratios between the UL isokinetic force generated on three directions were established. The velocity and straightness indexes of all children increased when they had to reach to targets placed more distant.

METHODS: 50 young adults (25 of each sex) performed the WPT using three different propulsion techniques in three different types of wheelchairs. Participants were asked to propel a wheelchair over 10 m at a comfortable speed. Time and number of pushes were recorded for three trials for each propulsion technique in each type of wheelchair.   RESULTS: All of the ICC(2,2) values were >0.83 for speed and number of pushes. Normative values for speed, number of pushes, push frequency and effectiveness categorized by propulsion technique, sex and wheelchair type were developed.

Objective: This study examined the effects of inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of prefrontal cortex on recognition memory in AD patients.   Methods: In a first experiment, 24 mild AD patients received sham and real 1Hz rTMS over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in different sessions, between encoding and retrieval phases of a non-verbal recognition memory task. In a second experiment, another group of 14 AD patients underwent sham controlled repeated sessions of 1Hz rTMS of the right DLPFC across a two week treatment. Non-verbal recognition memory task was performed at baseline, at the end of the two weeks period and at a follow up of 1 month.   Results: Right real rTMS significantly improved memory performance compared to right sham rTMS (p = 0.001). Left real rTMS left the memory performance unchanged as compared with left sham rTMS (p = 0.46). The two sham conditions did not differ between each other (p = 0.24). In the second experiment, AD patients treated with real rTMS showed an improvement of memory performance at the end of the two weeks treatment (p = 0.0009), that persisted at 1-month follow-up (p = 0.002).   Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that inhibitory rTMS over the right DLPFC can improve recognition memory function in AD patients. They also suggest the importance of a new approach of non-invasive brain stimulation as a promising treatment in AD.', b'Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease']

They have been successfully specified in interaction processes using methods from human-robot interaction. However, these methods often lack an expressive feedback system, are restricted to robot\xe2\x80\x99s on-board interaction capabilities and require a direct line of sight between human and robot. This negatively affects the user experience and interaction time. Therefore, we investigate the effect of a smart environment on the teaching of virtual borders with the objective to enhance the perceptual and interaction capabilities of a robot. For this purpose, we propose a novel interaction method based on a laser pointer, that leverages a smart home environment in the interaction process. This interaction method comprises an architecture for a smart home environment designed to support the interaction process, the cooperation of human, robot and smart environment in the interaction process, a cooperative perception including stationary and mobile cameras to perceive laser spots and an algorithm to extract virtual borders from multiple camera observations. The results of an experimental evaluation support our hypotheses that our novel interaction method features a significantly shorter interaction time and a better user experience compared to an approach without support of a smart environment. Moreover, the interaction method does not negatively affect other user requirements concerning completeness and accuracy.', b'Robot workspace restriction', b'smart home environment', b'Interactive restriction of a mobile robot\xe2\x80\x99s workspace in a smart home environment', b'2019-11-18', b'virtual borders', b'network robot system']

To this aim, they use a well-defined methodology meant to mitigate the risks of biases and ensure repeatability for later updates. SRs, however, involve significant effort.   Goal: The goal of this paper is to introduce a novel methodology that reduces the amount of manual tedious tasks involved in SRs while taking advantage of the value provided by human expertise.   Method: Starting from current methodologies for SRs, we replaced the steps of keywording and data extraction with an automatic methodology for generating a domain ontology and classifying the primary studies. This methodology has been applied in the Software Engineering sub-area of Software Architecture and evaluated by human annotators.   Results: The result is a novel Expert-Driven Automatic Methodology, EDAM, for assisting researchers in performing SRs. EDAM combines ontology-learning techniques and semantic technologies with the human-in-the-loop. The first (thanks to automation) fosters scalability, objectivity, reproducibility and granularity of the studies; the second allows tailoring to the specific focus of the study at hand and knowledge reuse from domain experts. We evaluated EDAM on the field of Software Architecture against six senior researchers. As a result, we found that the performance of the senior researchers in classifying papers was not statistically significantly different from EDAM.   Conclusions: Thanks to automation of the less-creative steps in SRs, our methodology allows researchers to skip the tedious tasks of keywording and manually classifying primary studies, thus freeing effort for the analysis and the discussion.', b'2019-11-24', b'Systematic reviews', b'Reducing the effort for systematic reviews in software engineering', b'software architecture', b'semantic web', b'software engineering']

Generally, self-recovery methods embed two types of data into the original image: check-bits for tamper detection and reference data for image recovery. Generating reference data is the primary challenge of every self-recovery method for more tamper resiliency and higher reconstruction quality. The proposed Multi-Rate Reference Embedding (MRRE) method makes unique reference data with several redundancy rates, instead of generating multiple reference data. According to the proposed methodology, the image is compressed by a source coding algorithm and the compressed data is separated into ten parts. Each part is protected by a channel coding algorithm based on pre-assigned redundancy rates. A fuzzy-based rate allocation system is used to assign the redundancy rates based on the importance of data. The generated data is packetized and randomly embedded into an image block. For tamper detection purpose, check-bits are generated by an MD5 hash function for every block. Both reference data and check-bits are embedded into three least significant bits (LSB) of the image pixels. To increase restoration efficiency, the proposed MRRE method provides ten scales of image recovery named highly-scalable self-recovery. The simulation results show an improvement in both tamper tolerability and reconstruction quality in comparison with the most recent methods.', b'fuzzy-based rate allocation', b'source-channel coding scheme', b'2019-11-21', b'Multi-rate reference embedding for highly-scalable self-recovery using fuzzy mamdani']

The role of USP13 is largely unknown in neurodegeneration. In this study we aim to demonstrate whether tau accumulation and/or clearance depends on ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination via USP-13. We used transgenic animal models of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) or P301L tau mutations and genetically knocked-down USP13 expression via shRNA to determine USP13 effects on tau ubiquitination and levels. We found a two-fold increase of USP13 levels in postmortem Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s disease (AD) brains. USP13 knockdown significantly increased the activity of the 20S proteasome and reduced the levels of hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in primary cortical neurons. USP13 knockdown also reduced the levels of amyloid and increased p-tau ubiquitination and clearance in transgenic animal models that overexpress murine tau as a result of the expression of familial APP mutations (TgAPP) and the human mutant P301L tau (rTg4510), respectively. Clearance of p-tau appears to be mediated by autophagy in these animal models. Taken together, these data suggest that USP13 knockdown reduces p-tau accumulation via regulation of ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination and mediates its clearance via autophagy and/or the proteasome. These results suggest that USP13 inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy to reduce accumulation of plaques and toxic p-tau in AD and human tauopathies.', b'USP13', b'2019-11-11', b'amyloid']

The most popular AMQ data structures are Bloom, Quotient and Cuckoo Filter (CF). The CF is more efficient than the Quotient and Bloom filters in term of the lookup time and false positive rate. An issue in CF is utilization of two hash functions in the query phase that increases the lookup time. Another issue is the relocation loop problem in the programming phase that attempts to find an empty bucket for the collied items. In this paper, a new approach called Single-hash Lookup Cuckoo Filter (SLCF) using one hash function to lookup an item is proposed. In the programming phase, SLCF utilizes a sequence of hash functions without any relocation to find an empty bucket and storing the overflowed items. It finds a bucket with an empty place and sets an index in the original bucket to the address of found bucket. To accelerate the query phase, a handle as a tiny part of the fingerprint is placed in conjunction with the index value in the bucket. In the query phase, only one hash function is used and if the queried item cannot be found in the bucket, the handle is investigated to membership checking. Otherwise, the second bucket pointed by the index is accessed. The simulation results for name search in the named data networking demonstrate that the lookup time is improved 27% for 16 million names in comparison to CF.']

The employability assessment model was developed a decade ago by rehabilitation counselors and has not been critically examined.   OBJECTIVE: This exploratory descriptive study aims to elicit key issues of employability assessment within Australian life insurance.   METHODS: Ten rehabilitation advisors with knowledge of employability assessment in the total and permanent disability sector participated in a single focus group. They each nominated issues of concern about employability assessment. These issues were collated then discussed within the group. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to identify key issues.   RESULTS: The predominant theme was the forensic nature of employment evidence. There were three categories of key issues. First, assessment providers\xe2\x80\x94 their training, qualifications, experience, and role. Second, methodology\xe2\x80\x94 approaches that provide most realistic information about a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s likelihood of work. Third, policy definitions that illustrate reliance on legal interpretation of employability.   CONCLUSIONS: To withstand legal scrutiny, the credentials of providers, assessment methodology, and quality of forensic reports are key issues which need to be addressed. This foundational study will contribute to broader research on this topic, with implications particularly for rehabilitation, life insurance, and claimants.', b'lump sum benefit']

We aimed to identify and describe the prevalence, patterns, magnitude and associated factors of trauma in the Emergency Department at Health Institute in Ethiopia.   METHODS:  In this systematic review, we searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature publications reporting the prevalence, pattern, magnitude and associated factors of trauma between 2000 and 2019. The documents which recruited are directly related to trauma and emergency department. In this regard, we searched databases of PubMed, Elsevier, Science directed, MEDLINE, and Google scholar by using Google as searching engine.

Among the injured participants, 53.4% of cases were living in Addis Ababa followed by Gondar and Jimma with 20.3% and 11.3% cases, respectively. Severe road traffic accident, occupational injury, and surgical patients were among the major risk factors of trauma. The mortality rate of the trauma case fatality was reached about 4%.

GDM is a state in which the pregnant women\xe2\x80\x99s blood glucose level exceeds the normal range. Our goal was to determine the best therapeutic method to control the blood glucose level among GDM patients by comparing of the efficacy between two Insulin consisting, Novo-rapid + Levemir Insulin and Regular + NPH Insulin.   METHOD:  In this double-blind, randomized clinical trial study, we enrolled 100 women with GDM as an inpatient. In group A, patients underwent treating with Regular + NPH Insulin, and in group B, patients underwent treating with Novo-rapid + Levemir Insulin. Patient\xe2\x80\x99s demographic and clinical information gathered by specified several times during the study and analysis performed by SPSS21.   RESULTS:  Despite significant changes in the two groups patient\xe2\x80\x99s blood glucose levels; we could not find any remarkable differences between the two groups. In the case of patient and health care system satisfaction and the length of the hospitalization group, B was better than group A.   CONCLUSION:  Altogether, The Novo-rapid and Levemir Insulin in comparing with the Regular and NPH Insulin were practically advantageous due to the simple using method and short hospitalization period of the patient. Thus, we prefer and suggest this beneficial method (using Novo-rapid and Levemir Insulin) to reach therapeutic goals.', b'insulin levemir', b'Comparison between the effect of regular human insulin and NPH with novo-rapid and levemir insulin in glycemic control in gestational diabetes', b'GDM', b'2019-11-14', b'insulin regular']

While much is known about barriers that employers report, little is known about employer practices that successfully overcome these barriers. Research about the effectiveness of employer practices is also lacking, making it difficult to translate research findings in actionable ways for employers.   OBJECTIVE: This study describes initial findings from the 2017 Kessler Foundation National Employment and Disability Survey-Supervisor Perspectives (KFNEDS-SP), which represents a new approach to investigating employer practices related to disability.   METHODS: The KFNEDS-SP, a web-based survey, was designed using standard, replicable survey methods and fielded via a Qualtrics business-to-business panel to supervisors at U.S. organizations. Respondents included 6,530 supervisors ages 18 and older from private, nonprofit, and governmental organizations across industries.   RESULTS: The study identifies several employer practices that are underused but that supervisors perceive to be highly effective for employees, generally, and employees with disabilities. It also highlights the importance of upper management commitment to accommodating employees with disabilities.   CONCLUSION: Information about the utilization and effectiveness of workplace practices will support new policies and programs to educate and assist employers as they strive to increase employment of people with disabilities.', b'The effectiveness of employer practices to recruit, hire, and retain employees with disabilities: Supervisor perspectives', b'employer practices', b'Disability']

The magnetic field shielding and optimization of two modules inside and outside the motor are realized by using Halbach permanent magnet array, and the magnetic field characteristics of the motor are improved. First, using analytical method and finite element method, the magnetic field characteristics and distribution of the permanent magnet of the motor are analyzed, and the electromagnetic characteristics of load and no load condition and output torque of the motor is analyzed by finite element method. Then, the loss of this motor is analyzed and calculated, the motor response surface equation is built by using taguchi method and central composite design method. Finally, the optimal structure parameters of motor is proposed by the numerical model based on maximizing the motor output torque of the target, and it is compared with finite element and experiment to verify the accuracy of the structural parameters. It provides a new theoretical basis for the follow-up optimization of the motor.', b'3-DOF motor', b'taguchi method', b'permanent magnet', b'Calculation and optimization of a permanent magnetic hybrid driven 3-DOF motor', b'undefined', b'torque', b'Halbach array', b'structure optimization', b'magnetic field calculation']

Often, such culture systems are used to elucidate the biotransformation of xenobiotics or drugs and further investigate drug and drug metabolite effects on biological systems in terms of potential therapeutic benefit or toxicity. Human hepatocytes currently used for such in vitro studies are mostly primary cells or cell lines derived from liver cancers. Both approaches have limitations such as low proliferation capacity and progressive dedifferentiation found in primary cells or lack of liver functions in cell lines, which makes it difficult to reliably predict biotransformation of xenobiotics in patients. In order to overcome these limitations, HepaFH3 cells and Upcyte\xc2\xae hepatocytes representing primary-like hepatocytes of the first and second generation are increasingly used. Based on primary human hepatocyte cells transduced for stable expression of Upcyte\xc2\xae proliferation genes, they are mitotically active and exhibit liver functions over an extended period, making them comparable to primary human hepatocytes. These hepatocyte models show active liver metabolism such as urea and glycogen formation as well as biotransformation of xenobiotics. The latter is based on the expression, activity and inducibility of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) as essential phase I reaction components. However, for further characterisation in terms of performance and existing limitations, additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in phase I reactions. One prerequisite is sufficient activity of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) functionally connected as electron donor to those CYP enzymes.   OBJECTIVE: For Upcyte\xc2\xae hepatocytes and HepaFH3 cells, it is so far unknown to what extent POR is expressed, active, and may exert CYP-modulating effects. Here we studied POR expression and corresponding enzyme activity in human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 and compared this with HepaFH3 and Upcyte\xc2\xae hepatocytes representing proliferating primary-like hepatocytes.   METHODS: POR expression of those hepatocyte models was determined at mRNA and protein level using qRT-PCR, Western Blot and immunofluorescence staining. Kinetic studies on POR activity in isolated microsomes were performed by a colorimetric method.   RESULTS: The investigated hepatocyte models showed remarkable differences at the level of POR expression. Compared to primary-like hepatocytes, POR expression of HepG2 cells was 4-fold higher at mRNA and 2-fold higher at protein level. However, this higher expression did not correlate with corresponding enzyme activity levels in isolated microsomes, which were comparable between all cell systems tested. A tendency of higher POR activity in HepG2 cells compared to HepaFH3 (p = 0.0829) might be present. Compared to primary human hepatocyte microsomes, POR activity was considerably lower in all hepatocyte models.   CONCLUSION: In summary, our study revealed that POR expression and activity were clearly detectable in all in vitro hepatocyte models with the highest POR expression in cancer cell line HepG2. However, POR activity was lower in tested hepatocyte models when compared to human primary hepatocyte microsomes.

Also, we size the extent to which employees\xe2\x80\x99 years of experience can moderate those relations. Questionnaire responses derived from employees in Chinese technology-driven firms were used to perform the statistical analysis and test the hypotheses drawn in this study. The individual\xe2\x80\x99s engagement in cooperative behaviors was proven to be rather unbiased among colleagues. Likewise, those dynamics led to positive perceptions of trust among them and added to the innovation capability of firms while an individual\xe2\x80\x99s years of experience didn\xe2\x80\x99t influence those dynamics. The present article examined two knowledge-sharing approaches used to ease cooperative behaviors among staff members. However, it is also necessary to examine the influence of other approaches in order to generate more precise comparisons of the frameworks that can yield better results. It is suggested that Chinese firms adopt a more reflexive learning approach that would facilitate individual\xe2\x80\x99s engagement in cooperative behavior that lead to innovation. These results can be useful for managers in industries such as software-engineering and product-design which depend heavily on the effective transmission of knowledge among staff.', b'oswaldojim@gmail.com', b'Impact of Individual\xe2\x80\x99s Cooperative Behaviors on Innovation: Evidence from China', b'knowledge sharing', b'China', b'2019-11-21', b'innovation capability']

Through summarizing and analyzing the characteristics of chain retail enterprises, this paper proposes to build a hierarchical and differentiated incentive mechanism by cultivating retail culture. The result shows that the knowledge staff is been higher the education level, the work creativity is stronger, cooperates the demand to the team members. In the era of the knowledge economy, knowledge has replaced capital as the core source of the enterprise core competence. The performance evaluation of knowledge workers is complex and the performance of the general staff is often easier to get a more objective evaluation.

However, risk for some severe diseases like cancer typically increase with age. Most insight into cancer treatment comes from mixed-age patient cohorts, leading to a lack of detailed understanding of cancer drug effects in the elderly population. There is growing evidence that cancer drug effects can be influenced by dehydration conditions often found in older people. Colon cancer remains the second leading cause of death by cancer in Europe. Inter- and intra-heterogeneity of tumors contribute to why some individuals do not respond to specific cancer therapies or may often suffer a relapse.   OBJECTIVE: Our study applies an in vitro drug test system for simulating treatment with cytostatics of colorectal cancer in elderly patients with dehydration condition.   METHODS: Two well-known colon cancer cell lines, Caco-2 and RKO, harboring defined cancer-related mutations, were step-wisely adapted from routine culture medium to a severe hyperosmotic condition (397 mOmol/kg) by adding sodium chloride to the medium. We investigated the effects of these cell culture conditions, which should mimic cellular dehydration in elderly people, on the growth characteristics of the cells. Therefore, cell proliferation was investigated by measuring population doubling times. Furthermore, we investigated how the metabolic activity of the cells was influenced by treatment with different concentrations of cyclophosphamide (CPA) under normal and hyperosmotic conditions.   RESULTS: We found that Caco-2 and RKO cell lines have an identical cell doubling time of 23 hours in normosmotic medium. However, hyperosmotic medium lifted the doubling time of Caco-2 cells to 31 hours while that of RKO cells did not change. Despite reduced cell proliferation rates, hyperosmotic medium sensitized Caco-2 cells to treatment with 10 mM CPA for 48 hours as measured by metabolic activity assays on ATP levels.   CONCLUSIONS: The two investigated colon cancer cells lines reacted differently to hyperosmotic conditions. Only the growth of Caco-2 cells was reduced by increased osmolality. Despite this reduced growth their sensitivity to an alkylating cytostatic agent was even slightly increased.

In the present study, reaction time (RT) employing Trails B of the Trail Making Test, with responses capped at 300 s, was investigated in SIVCI (n = 27) compared to cognitively healthy aging (CH) (n = 26). RT was significantly slowed in SIVCI compared to CH (Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s d effect size = 1.26).

Link prediction is addressed as a semi-supervised learning problem where the task is to predict a larger part of networks using available knowledge of smaller parts. By this assumption, social network extraction is translated into a classification problem. While in real case scenarios majority of links are unknown, we hypothesis self-training as the most common semi-supervised learning method can provide an effective approach for learning from unlabelled data. We proposed an interpolative self-training technique that leverages node information to generate a set of examples in learning phase along with their connections as their associated labels. The approach generates data by interpolation of documents assigned to a pair of nodes. Documents as the implicit content shared between the individual nodes provide a scope for the estimation of their similarities. Then generated training data are employed in a link prediction model with two different scenarios. The first scenario interprets the link prediction as a conventional classification problem in which we have examples from both positive (link) and negative (no-link) classes. However, the second scenario addresses more realistic case where only some positive examples (links or connections) are known. Social networks are usually very sparse structures. The sparsity of social networks implies that in the classification framework of link prediction, we deal with an imbalance class distribution in which among all possible links there are a few connections (positive class) vs. many disconnections (negative class). In order to deal with class skew and enhance the performance of the classifier, a data selection method based on node similarity was proposed. To evaluate the merit of the proposed methods, a set of experiments were conducted on co-authorship networks of 18 different domains. The result implies the feasibility of achieving significantly high performance for most of the networks using the proposed self training approach.', b'classification problem']

In Korea, desks and chairs for primary schools have seven different height levels, and these levels are regulated by the national standard KSG-2010. These levels serve to accommodate children of all heights, but the choice problem remains because of the many alternatives.   OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the anthropometric feasibility of the currently used guidelines for the selection of height level for Korean primary school furniture. In addition, we examine children\xe2\x80\x99s ability to select anthropometrically recommendable desk and seat heights.   METHODS: In study 1, anthropometric data from 2005 Korean children were acquired and a mismatch analysis was performed under the assumption that children were paired with the height level recommended by the guidelines. In study 2, we conducted a desk and seat height selection experiment that included 36 children.   RESULTS: The results of study 1 revealed that about three quarters of children could be matched by following the guidelines. The results of study 2 showed that a quarter of children selected matchable desk and seat heights by themselves. We developed new guidelines using classification algorithms based on the employed data in study 1, and it was confirmed that the new guidelines could significantly increase the degree of match.   CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the currently used guidelines need to be revised and that children had difficulty in selecting the appropriate height of school furniture by themselves. The new guidelines suggested in this study are expected to contribute to the correct usage by Korean primary school children.', b'primary school children', b'Evaluation of the guidelines and children\xe2\x80\x99s ability to select the anthropometrically recommendable height of school furniture: A case study of Korean primary school children', b'School furniture', b'seat height', b'guideline', b'anthropometry']

Regular exercise via sports can create positive effects on the respiratory systems of boys as well as on their overall growth and development. To help identify deviations from positive trends in these areas, respiratory function tests have become an essential part of the diagnosis and assessment of pulmonary disease.   OBJECTIVE:  To investigate the effect of different types of sports on pulmonary functions and respiratory muscle strength and to help establish baseline reference values in healthy Turkish boys aged 8\xe2\x80\x9312 years.   METHODS:  A total of 624 healthy boys, who train at least twice a week for football (128), basketball (105), archery (60), swimming (111) and wrestling (74), as well as 146 boys who do not perform regular physical activities voluntarily, participated in the study. To evaluate and potentially differentiate amongst the merits of these several sports, we obtained a variety of baseline measurements from our subjects, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, maximal peak expiratory flow (PEF max), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP).   RESULTS:  There were statistically significant differences amongst the types of sports regarding the various metrics we examined: FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF max, MVV, MIP and MEP (p< 0.05). The active boys showed higher mean values for pulmonary functions and respiratory muscle strength than the passive ones. Also, the wrestlers generally had better respiratory parameters than those of athletes in the other four sports we investigated.   CONCLUSIONS:  It was clear that exercise, especially regarding pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength, produced better outcomes in the active boys compared with our control group of relatively passive boys. The mechanisms responsible for this difference are likely due to the resistance effect of exercise.', b'boys', b'Pulmonary functions', b'respiratory muscle strength', b'exercise']

Objective: We aimed to examine changes in the age-specific prevalence of cognitive impairment in the Czech Republic.   Methods: The study used two samples from the population-based Czech Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Age-specific prevalence of cognitive impairment (defined based on scores in verbal fluency, immediate recall, delayed recall, and temporal orientation) was compared between participants in wave 2 (2006/2007; n = 1,107) and wave 6 (2015; n = 3,104).

Multiple sensitivity analyses, focusing on alternative operationalizations of relative cognitive impairment, impact of missing cognitive data, and survival bias, were carried out.   Results: The most conservative estimate suggested that the age-specific prevalence of cognitive impairment declined by one fifth, from 11% in 2006/2007 to 9% in 2015.

Due to the frequent frame damages and losses in wireless networks, temporal asynchrony occurs and results in serious visual fatigue for viewers. In order to provide higher quality 3D video, this paper proposes a new scheme termed the Temporal Synchronization Scheme (TSS) for live 3D video streaming. TSS delivers video frames for the left and right views in the same frame sequence with the same transmission priority, and it compensates for frame damage and losses during the decoding phase. In addition, a new metric called the Stereoscopic Temporal Variation Index (STVI) is proposed; it measures the degree of temporal asynchrony in 3D video. Subjective assessments demonstrate that STVI is an objective metric for measuring subjective quality given that it exhibits a strong positive correlation with the subjective MOS rating. This paper demonstrates that TSS significantly improves the visual quality of 3D videos given the use of STVI and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) even when frame damage and losses occur. The contributions of the paper are as follows: i) The proposed TSS is the first scheme to address the temporal asynchrony issue in live 3D video streaming over wireless networks. ii) TSS only requires slight modifications to decoders. iii) A new metric (i.e., STVI) is proposed to measure the degree of temporal asynchrony in 3D videos. Therefore, 3D video streaming over wireless networks can be performed with temporal synchronization, and it is expected using TSS will reduce visual fatigue.', b'2019-11-19', b'IEEE 802.11 wireless networks']

OSCAR is a user-friendly search platform that can be used to search any RDF triplestore providing a SPARQL endpoint, while hiding the complexities of SPARQL, thus making the search operations accessible to those who are not experts in Semantic Web technologies. We present here the basic features and the main extensions of this latest version of OSCAR. In addition, we demonstrate how it can be adapted to work with different SPARQL endpoints containing scholarly data, using as examples the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC) and the OpenCitations Index of Crossref open DOI-to-DOI citations (COCI), both provided by OpenCitations, and also the Wikidata dataset provided by the Wikimedia Foundation. We conclude by reporting the usage statistics of OSCAR, retrieved from the OpenCitations website logs, so as to demonstrate its uptake.', b'OCC', b'Enabling text search on SPARQL endpoints through OSCAR']

Vagueness and impreciseness in the sample data require fuzzy techniques to be employed in the analysis. These techniques can be based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, type-2 fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets, or spherical fuzzy sets. In this paper, Z-fuzzy numbers are used to capture the vagueness in the sample data and develop Z-fuzzy hypothesis testing. A Z-fuzzy number is represented by a restriction function that is usually a triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy number and a reliability function representing the confidence level to the restriction function. Illustrative examples for left and right sided hypothesis testing and sensitivity analyses are presented.', b'reliability function']

Methods: Eighty older people with mild dementia were recruited and randomly assigned to a Tai Chi group or a control group.
