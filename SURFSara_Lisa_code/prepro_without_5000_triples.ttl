    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Virtual borders are employed to allow humans the interactive and flexible restriction of their mobile robots’ workspaces in human-centered environments, e.g. to exclude privacy zones from the workspace or to indicate certain areas for working. They have been successfully specified in interaction processes using methods from human-robot interaction. However, these methods often lack an expressive feedback system, are restricted to robot’s on-board interaction capabilities and require a direct line of sight between human and robot. This negatively affects the user experience and interaction time. Therefore, we investigate the effect of a smart environment on the teaching of virtual borders with the objective to enhance the perceptual and interaction capabilities of a robot. For this purpose, we propose a novel interaction method based on a laser pointer, that leverages a smart home environment in the interaction process. This interaction method comprises an architecture for a smart home environment designed to support the interaction process, the cooperation of human, robot and smart environment in the interaction process, a cooperative perception including stationary and mobile cameras to perceive laser spots and an algorithm to extract virtual borders from multiple camera observations. The results of an experimental evaluation support our hypotheses that our novel interaction method features a significantly shorter interaction time and a better user experience compared to an approach without support of a smart environment. Moreover, the interaction method does not negatively affect other user requirements concerning completeness and accuracy."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "The emerging predictive health analytics provides great promise in reducing costs and improving health outcomes. However, most predictive models do not capture environmental exposures that impact health risk patterns in several chronic diseases such as asthma. This gap prompted the development of the exposome paradigm to improve health intervention and prevention by providing meaningful and understandable feedback on individuals’ collected data and minimizing their exposures to health risks. The exposome paradigm focuses on the simultaneous monitoring of mobility behaviors and measurement of environmental conditions to capture their impact on human health. In this paper, we introduce the concept of exposome analytics that compliments predictive analytics to develop an effective health monitoring and management system. We present the current analytical developments including our ongoing project to manage risks of asthma exacerbations as a case study. Our proposed approach uses a novel exposome assessment paradigm that utilizes the spatio-temporal properties of the data in the model training process and hence results in improving the accuracy of asthma prediction. The quality of the proposed approach is extensively evaluated using real patients and environmental datasets."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Daily human activity recognition using sensor data can be a fundamental task for many real-world applications, such as home monitoring and assisted living. One of the challenges in human activity recognition is to distinguish activities that have infrequent occurrence and less distinctive patterns. We propose a hierarchical classifier to perform two-phase learning. In the first phase the classifier learns general features to recognise majority classes, and the second phase is to collect minority and subtle classes to identify fine difference between them. We compare our proposal with a collection of state-of-the-art classification techniques on four real-world third-party datasets that involve different types of object sensors and are collected in different environments and on different subjects and six imbalanced datasets from the UCI-Irvine Machine Learning repository. Our results demonstrate that our hierarchical classifier approach performs better than state-of-the-art techniques including both structure- and feature-based learning techniques. The key novelty of our approach is that we reduce the bias of the ensemble classifier by training it on a subspace of data, which allows identification of activities with subtle differences, and thus provides well-discriminating features."@en ;

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the water quality and the process of changes in the water quality parameters of this river by graphic methods such as Wilcox, Schuler and Piper diagrams. These charts were used to monitor water quality and evaluate the data obtained from Berthaen Station from 1976 to 2007. In this study, Piper introduced water qualitative type of chlorine and water façade from saddle type. Based on the Schuler diagram, all water samples of the river Rudan are in a moderate and acceptable category for drinking and there is no barrier to drinking. The Wilcox chart also shows that most of the specimens are highly salty and suitable for farming (C3S1, C3S2) and in some water are poor, highly unsuitable water areas (C4S2). The results of water quality parameters analysis using non-parametric Mann-Kendall test showed that the parameters of acidity, carbonate, soluble salts, total cations, sodium, magnesium and chloride adsorption percentages, and other parameters were not trendy at the surface The confidence is 95%. The upward trend in water soluble solute changes indicates a decrease in water quality and an increase in soluble salts of this river."@en ;

This paper presents the overview of various integration approaches with different degree of maturity and describes the concept of deep integration for mechatronic products conducted by ProSTEP iViP Association which combines existing standards in engineering collaboration context. Version 3 of the current ProSTEP iViP Recommendation PSI 5 entitled “ECAD/MCAD-Collaboration” provides a comprehensive specification for collaboration between the ECAD and MCAD worlds. A considerable number of vendors have now implemented the underlying data schema and integrated it in the corresponding products.

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: Axillary Ultrasound (AUS) is now performed as a protocol in every newly diagnosed breast cancer in most European countries. It is an inexpensive and sensitive tool in hands of a trained operator. All AUS negative patients undergo Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB), while AUS positive patients bypass SLNB and undergo axillary nodal clearance (ANC) as a standard protocol. We wish to analyse these two groups to see if ANC can be foregone in these patients.   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To compare and analyse the axillary disease burden in early breast cancer patients, with positive axilla, detected by AUS+ Biopsy versus those patients with normal axillary ultrasound or negative axillary biopsy that underwent ANC due to positive SLNB.   MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients who underwent axillary lymph node clearance following histologically confirmed positive ultrasound (US) axilla (year 2009–2014) was performed and was compared with data collected for patients with USG negative but SLNB (OSNA- One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification) positive axilla.   RESULTS: Axillary clearances performed for positive US axilla yielded significantly more positive lymph nodes than SLNB/OSNA positive axilla (p = 0.00496). These patients also had larger primary tumours (median 33 mm versus 21 mm, p = 0.01242) of a higher grade. Almost half of the patients in AUS positive group (49%) had high axillary nodal burden (>4 LNs). This is in great contrast with AUS negative, SLNB/OSNA positive group where 82.7% of patients had <4 positive nodes with more than half patients (51.7%) having no further positive nodes in their final histopathology specimen.   CONCLUSIONS: ANC should be a standard protocol in AUS positive patients as they invariably have high axillary disease burden while ANC can be omitted in case of select AUS negative and SLNB patients. However, further studies with more subjects may be require to substantiate the findings."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: Breast cytology is a significant component of the “Triple approach” for pre-operative diagnosis of breast lumps, the other two being clinical assessment and radiological imaging. The role of Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) as a first line investigation in diagnosing breast lesions is well documented, however histopathology is the gold standard. Cyto-histopathological correlation is of great relevance and also increases precision.   AIMS \\& OBJECTIVES: The present study was conducted with the aim to categorize breast lesions according to the latest standardized reporting system proposed by International academy of cytologists (IAC) in 2016. Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of FNAC in diagnosing breast lesions and cyto-histopathological correlation was planned.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: All FNAs of breast lesions over a period of 2 years were included in the study. The cases were grouped into five standardized categories proposed by the International academy of cytology: Category I (Insufficient material), Category II (Benign), Category III (Atypical, probably benign), Category IV (Suspicious, probably in situ or invasive) & Category V (Malignant) respectively. Specificity, sensitivity, diagnostic accuracy, negative and positive predictive value of FNAC were calculated and cyto-histopathological correlation assessed wherever possible.   RESULTS: Out of 468 breast lesions reported on FNAC, the category wise distribution was – Category I, II, III, IV & V accounting for 23(4.9%), 342(73.07%), 7(1.5%), 11(2.35%) and 85(18.16%) respectively. Histopathology was performed in 331/468 cases with cyto histological concordance of 98.4% and a type agreement rate of 90.9%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy was 98.90%, 99.16%, 97.82%, 99.58% and 99.09% respectively.   CONCLUSION: FNAC is a simple, reliable, cost effective, first line diagnostic procedure for all breast lumps. In collaboration with physical examination and imaging studies (triple approach), FNAC is a highly sensitive diagnostic tool. Adopting a universally acceptable standardized reporting system for breast cytology can enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FNAC."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Intravesical Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) has been the gold standard immunotherapy to treat high risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) for over 40 years. Attenuation of Mycobacterium bovis for clinical use as BCG results in loss of its ability to activate the “Stimulator of Interferon Genes” (STING) pathway and potentially limits local anti-tumor immune activity and subsequent BCG responsiveness due to reduced induction of the immune cell recruiting chemokines primarily, CXCL10. We conducted the current study to determine the potential of STING pathway agonist in synergizing with BCG to enhance chemokine induction.   Methods: The TICE strain of BCG (OncoTICE) was used in combination with STING agonist to determine STING pathway activation and CXCL10 production in THP-1 monocytic cell line, THP-1 defNLRP3, THP-1 dual STING knock out cells, RT112 bladder cancer cells and primary bladder epithelial cells. NanoString platform-based gene expression profiling and multiplex cytokine analysis were performed to determine induction of interferon associated genes and secreted cytokines.   Results: Activation of cytosolic pattern recognition receptor and downstream IFN1 pathways demonstrated synergistic activation of STING pathway enhanced BCG induced inflammasome and STING pathway gene expression in monocytes and bladder cancer cells. The significant differences in CXCL10, CCL5, IL-8 and MIP-1a/1b amongst the knock-out cell lines confirm the convergence of these pathways following combination treatment with BCG and STING agonist.   Conclusions: Findings from our study are the first evidence indicating that STING pathway activators are promising new innate immune modulators with a potential to synergize with BCG therapy in the treatment of NMIBC."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are extremely expensive and most patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) do not benefit significantly from their use.   Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine response rates and survival outcomes on patients with mUC progressing despite prior platinum-based chemotherapy receiving ICI stratified by biomarker status.   Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search for all articles in PubMed and Embase up to 06/15/2019 to identify all studies pertaining to programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor targeted therapies for mUC that reported biomarkers. Given that biomarkers are reported on different scales and with different metrics, we defined each biomarker as either positive or negative using the definitions implemented in each individual trial. We meta-analyzed the data, reconstructed overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) curves, and analyzed response rates by biomarker status. OS and PFS were analyzed in a pooled Kaplan-Meier analysis and pseudo-individualized patient data (IPD) extracted.   Results: We identified 1429 manuscripts of which 8 met inclusion criteria, with a total of 1837 treated patients with outcomes data. On proportional hazards survival analysis, patients in the biomarker negative group were associated with a lower PFS (HR 1.48, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.85, p < 0.001) and lower OS (HR 1.54, 95% CI: 1.32 - 1.80, p < 0.001) when compared to the biomarker positive group. Response data was available for 1641 patients and random effects proportion show complete response in 8% and 3% in biomarker positive and negative patients, respectively.   Conclusions: ICI therapy for metastatic UC post platinum therapy has a higher overall response rate, OS and PFS in patients who are biomarker positive compared to those who are negative. However, some patients who are biomarker negative do achieve complete responses. A better biomarker for patient selection is essential before biomarkers can be used to stratify candidates for ICI therapy."@en ;

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of balance taping on PFPS.   METHODS: Balance taping using kinesiology tape was applied for 2.5 months (average of 16 h/day) to both knees in a 26-year-old female nurse with bilateral PFPS.   RESULTS:  The congruence angle decreased in the right and left knees from 30∘ to 5∘ and from 20∘ to 5∘, respectively. The Patient Specific Functional Scale score increased from 17/50 to 50/50, indicating improved functional state of the knees, while the Numeric Pain Rating Scale scores for from sitting to standing, from standing to sitting, and kneeling improved from 6/10 and 0/10, indicating no pain in the knee joints. Application of repeated balance taping for 2.5 months reduced PFPS.   CONCLUSION: Considering the outcome of the study, we recommend balance taping as a complementary treatment method for PFPS."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:  Bone marrow oedema is a multifactorial conditioned illness. Alongside any strain relief of an affected joint, treatment with Iloprost also belongs to the choice of cures. In past studies, a modulatory effect on bone could be shown. The hypothesis of the present work is that Iloprost has a growth-stimulating effect on osteoblasts in vitro.   METHODS:  Human osteoblasts were isolated and cultivated. Subsequently, the cells were treated with Iloprost in bioavailable concentrations. Alterations of the cell structure were examined by means of light microscopy. A regulation of the number of vital cells was carried out by using a CASY cell counter. Possible cell impairment after Iloprost treatment was analysed by means of XTT Elisa as well as FDA and PI staining via fluorescence microscopy.   RESULTS:  Using light microscopy, no changes in cell structure could be observed. With the CASY cell counter, no increase in the numbers of osteoblasts appeared after Iloprost treatment. Also, XTT Elisas and fluorescence microscopy did not reveal any cell impairment due to Iloprost.   CONCLUSION:  Our results could not confirm a modulatory effect in mature osteoblasts. On the basis of the present work we could not verify any growth-stimulating effect by Iloprost in mature osteoblasts in vitro. Admittedly, effects had been shown previously during osteogenesis, but we do exclude an effect on mature osteoblasts which have already differentiated."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND:  Spinal disorders are common health problems which include wide categories of diseases that affect the spinal soft tissues, joints and bone.   OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of high intensity laser therapy (HILT) on pain and function in patients with spinal disorders.   METHODS:  Six databases were searched up to the end of February 2018 including PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Open Grey and Grey Literature Report. In addition, the reference lists of all included studies were searched for any relevant studies. PEDro scale and GRADE system were performed to assess the quality of the studies. A meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the overall effect size.   RESULTS:  A total of ten randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria, with four studies of the efficacy of HILT on neck pain (NP) and six on low back pain (LBP). According to the PEDro scale assessment, only two studies were rated as high quality, while the remainder were rated as fair or low quality. Forest plots showed that HILT with exercise was significantly more effective than placebo HILT with exercise in terms of pain reduction (SMD -1.11; 95% CI -1.42 to -0.80; P< 0.00001; I2 0%) and functional improvement (SMD -1.03; 95% CI -1.33 to -0.72; P< 0.00001; I2 0%). Meta-analyses also showed that HILT alone or HILT with conventional physiotherapy (CPT) significantly provided better outcomes than CPT alone.   CONCLUSIONS:  HILT is considered as a complementary modality for pain reduction and function improvement in patients with spinal disorders. However, the quality of the body of evidence was rated from ‘very low’ to ‘low’ quality. Further high quality trials are required for standardisation of irradiation parameters and the treatment protocol to establish the efficacy of HILT for spinal disorders."@en ;

METHOD: In this prospective open randomised monocentric study 19 patients (age ≥65, movement restrictions and symptomatic leg oedema) received knee-length compression stockings with an interface pressure of 18–21 mmHg (stocking type 1) and 23–32 mmHg (stocking type 2). On two consecutive days each of the two compression stocking types were worn for at least 8 hours. After this test period, both stocking types were assessed subjectively and skin changes were recorded.   RESULT: A significantly (p-value <0.001) subjective improvement of the symptoms and complaints based on leg oedema was reported with the knee-length compression stockings. The Stocking type 1 recorded a significantly (p = 0,045) better wearing comfort. In addition, the Stocking type 2 was significantly too large amongst women in the front foot area (p = 0.044). The most common side effects were constrictions on the proximal lower leg (stocking type 1 = 73,7% (14/19); stocking type 2 = 78,9% (15/19)). Subjects with arthritis (p = 0.006), hallux valgus (p = 0.034) and/or digitus flexus (p = 0.021) found the socking type 1 significantly more comfortable.   CONCLUSION: In order to achieve optimal patient compliance it is recommended to prescribe knee-length compression stockings with an interface pressure of 18–21 mmHg if the following criteria are met: age ≥65 years, female sex, arthritis, digitus flexus (claw toe) or hallux valgus."@en ;

The possible involvement of COX-2 and TGase 2, key enzymes of inflammation and ECM remodeling, in these processes offers starting points for targeted adjuvant therapy in the course of various bone healing phases. Our investigations show the feasibility of the selected dual-tracer approach for PET/CT imaging. In principle, this approach can be extended by further PET tracers for the functional characterization of physiological processes such as hypoxia/reperfusion or selected molecular players."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "INTRODUCTION: Since the beginning of industrial production in 1950, plastic production has continued to grow strongly worldwide and is now at 322 million tonnes in the year 2015. From these very high production volumes ever larger quantities are found in the environment. There the plastics degradate to microplasticity and spread ubiquitously in the world. The present work deals with the possible uptake of microplastic particles in human organisms. For the detection of these plastic particles, an extraction method was developed and validated.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biological materials consist of human blood (healthy volunteers, n = 4) and different tissues of pigs and cattles. Various lysis solutions were tested for degradation efficiency of biological material and for effects on the plastics. The mass loss, surfaces and structure variations as well as the physicochemical spectrum of the material were observed after treatment by atomic force (AFM) and electron microscopy (EM) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR).   RESULTS: The different plastic types as polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) could be clearly differentiated and identified by FTIR. Regarding the surface control, especially PVC showed detectable alterations: After extraction an irregular surface structure caused by protuberances or bubbles could be observed. However, instead of these alterations an equivalent count of plastic particles was found in correlation to the applied plastic amount (recovery rate overall was 99,12±0,67%).   CONCLUSION: The applied method can be used for plastic extractions from human or animal tissues without remarkable effects on the plastics."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Percutaneous coronary intervention is the most often used method for coronary revascularization. Stenting restores blood perfusion to ischemic areas, but it also causes mechanical disruption of the atheromatous plaque and the nearby endothelium, stimulating the activation of platelets. In a similar way, platelets are activated by thrombin exposure in the setting of plaque rupture. The interaction between platelets, oxidative stress and inflammation is an important factor determining the extent and severity of vascular dysfunction observed in these settings. Platelets activated by the vessel trauma release inflammatory and mitogenic mediators into the vascular microenvironment, activating leukocyte chemotaxis and switching the endothelial phenotypefrom a quiescent to an activate one. The increased bioavailability of reactive oxygen species from the vessel wall, from leukocytes and from platelets, and the subsequent decreased bioavailability of nitric oxide, further stimulates platelets, which are otherwise inhibited by this endothelial mediator. Thus, inflammation, oxidative stress and platelet activation cooperate in a feed-forward mechanism leading to vascular dysfunction and possibly compromising the effect of stenting. Inhibitors of platelet function have thus important ancillary effects beyond their antithrombotic ones, which will be discussed in the present short review."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Context: Systematic Reviews (SRs) are means for collecting and synthesizing evidence from the identification and analysis of relevant studies from multiple sources. To this aim, they use a well-defined methodology meant to mitigate the risks of biases and ensure repeatability for later updates. SRs, however, involve significant effort.   Goal: The goal of this paper is to introduce a novel methodology that reduces the amount of manual tedious tasks involved in SRs while taking advantage of the value provided by human expertise.   Method: Starting from current methodologies for SRs, we replaced the steps of keywording and data extraction with an automatic methodology for generating a domain ontology and classifying the primary studies. This methodology has been applied in the Software Engineering sub-area of Software Architecture and evaluated by human annotators.   Results: The result is a novel Expert-Driven Automatic Methodology, EDAM, for assisting researchers in performing SRs. EDAM combines ontology-learning techniques and semantic technologies with the human-in-the-loop. The first (thanks to automation) fosters scalability, objectivity, reproducibility and granularity of the studies; the second allows tailoring to the specific focus of the study at hand and knowledge reuse from domain experts. We evaluated EDAM on the field of Software Architecture against six senior researchers. As a result, we found that the performance of the senior researchers in classifying papers was not statistically significantly different from EDAM.   Conclusions: Thanks to automation of the less-creative steps in SRs, our methodology allows researchers to skip the tedious tasks of keywording and manually classifying primary studies, thus freeing effort for the analysis and the discussion."@en ;

Pregnancy is a critical stage of development during which maternal nutrition can strongly influence obstetric and neonatal outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of pregnancy on the full blood count parameters of pregnant women of African descent residing in Sokoto, North Western Nigeria. This case-control study investigated 74 pregnant subjects and 22 non-pregnant controls. The mean age and income of the subjects were 28.00 ± 8.295 and 2760.42 ± 7975.178 respectively. Haematological parameters were determined using a fully automated 5-part differential haematology analyzer (Model Mythic 22-CT, Orpheee, Switzerland). Results obtained of pregnant subjects were compared with that of non-pregnant controls. The prevalence of anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (Platelet count < 140 × 109/L) was 58.11% and 6.75% respectively among the pregnant subjects. The mean haemoglobin, PCV, platelet and red cell count were significantly lower among the pregnant subjects (10.7 ± 0.13 g/dl and 31.4 ± 0.38%, 252.7 ± 14.35 × 109/L and 3.7 ± 0.04) compared to the non-pregnant controls (12.2 ± 0.44 g/dl, 36.2 ± 1.17 %, 362.7 ± 36.51 × 109/L and 4.3 ± 0.11) (p= 0.004, 0.001, 0.009 and 0.000) respectively. There were no significant differences in the total white blood cell count between the pregnant subjects (5.3 ± 0.22) and non-pregnant controls (4.6 ± 0.59) (p= 0.267). The Neutrophils count was significantly higher among the pregnant subjects (42.6 ± 3.06) compared to the non-pregnant controls (20.0 ± 2.33) (p= 0.000).

This study aimed to examine the drivers, challenges, and opportunities of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and to identify new evidence for future policy making in Ethiopia.   METHOD:  A narrative review of the literature related to EMS was undertaken to describe the drivers, challenges, and opportunities for EMS in Ethiopia from July, 2000 to September, 2018. The search was done from four relevant electronic databases: MEDLINE, Science Directs, Scopus and PubMed by using Google Scholar and Google with key search words used mainly as “Emergency Medical services in Ethiopia”. The inclusion criteria were an original study or review studies involving Emergency Medical Services in Ethiopia. Among the available papers, the relevant articles were selected while the irrelevant ones were excluded.   RESULTS:  There was lack of trained emergency medical providers and misdistribution of trained professionals, immaturity of the program, lack of partnership and stakeholders and lack of motivation towards Emergency medical services. Emergency medical services hamper significant problems similar to other African countries that required being addressed in Ethiopia context for achieving the program and in order to obtain intended outcomes for the country.   CONCLUSION:  A long-term discussion is needed to further improve the services system in various health care facilities. An Emergency Medical services policy making and analysis framework is needed to make quality emergency medical care at Emergency department in hospitals and outside the hospitals."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Emerging markets contain the vast majority of the world’s population. Despite the enormous number of inhabitants, these markets still lack a proper finance infrastructure. One of the main difficulties felt by customers is the access to loans. This limitation arises from the fact that most customers usually lack a verifiable credit history. As such, traditional banks are unable to provide loans. This paper proposes credit scoring modeling based on non-traditional-data, acquired from smartphones, for loan classification processes. We use Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models which are the top linear models in traditional banking. Then we compared the transformation of the training datasets creating boolean indicators against the categorization using Weight of Evidence (WoE). Our models surpassed the performance of the manual loan application selection process, improving the approval rate and decreasing the overdue rate. Compared to the baseline, the loans approved by meeting the criteria of the SVM model presented a decreased overdue rate. At the same time, using the score generated by a SVM model we were able to grant more loans. This paper shows that credit scoring can be useful in emerging markets. The non-traditional data can be used to build robust algorithms that can identify good borrowers as in traditional banking."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "The traditional trajectory privacy protection algorithm approaches the task as a single-layer problem. Taking a perspective in harmony with an approach more characteristic of human thinking, in which complex problems are solved hierarchically, we propose a two-level hierarchical granularity model for this problem. The first level of the proposed model is a coarse-grained layer, in which the original dataset is divided into groups. The second level is a fine-grained layer, where problems are solved in each group instead of on the original dataset, which reduces complexity and computation while improving efficiency. On the basis of this hierarchical model, we propose the interpolation trajectory-anonymous privacy protection algorithm with temporal and spatial granularity constraints. In addition, we propose interpolation-based modified Hausdorff distance on adjacent segment (IMHD_AS), which provides a smaller clustering area and better data utility than the traditional Euclidean distance, as the trajectory similarity criterion for clustering within each group. Further, we theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional algorithm in terms of data distortion and anonymity cost and verify its efficacy experimentally. Compared with the classic anonymity algorithm, the maximum information loss and the anonymity cost are reduced by up to 21.04% and 28.32%, respectively."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "In this paper, learning social networks from incomplete relationship data is proposed. Link prediction is addressed as a semi-supervised learning problem where the task is to predict a larger part of networks using available knowledge of smaller parts. By this assumption, social network extraction is translated into a classification problem. While in real case scenarios majority of links are unknown, we hypothesis self-training as the most common semi-supervised learning method can provide an effective approach for learning from unlabelled data. We proposed an interpolative self-training technique that leverages node information to generate a set of examples in learning phase along with their connections as their associated labels. The approach generates data by interpolation of documents assigned to a pair of nodes. Documents as the implicit content shared between the individual nodes provide a scope for the estimation of their similarities. Then generated training data are employed in a link prediction model with two different scenarios. The first scenario interprets the link prediction as a conventional classification problem in which we have examples from both positive (link) and negative (no-link) classes. However, the second scenario addresses more realistic case where only some positive examples (links or connections) are known. Social networks are usually very sparse structures. The sparsity of social networks implies that in the classification framework of link prediction, we deal with an imbalance class distribution in which among all possible links there are a few connections (positive class) vs. many disconnections (negative class). In order to deal with class skew and enhance the performance of the classifier, a data selection method based on node similarity was proposed. To evaluate the merit of the proposed methods, a set of experiments were conducted on co-authorship networks of 18 different domains. The result implies the feasibility of achieving significantly high performance for most of the networks using the proposed self training approach."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND:  An enthusiasm for physical exercise is often developed in the paediatric age group through collective game-based sporting activities. Regular exercise via sports can create positive effects on the respiratory systems of boys as well as on their overall growth and development. To help identify deviations from positive trends in these areas, respiratory function tests have become an essential part of the diagnosis and assessment of pulmonary disease.   OBJECTIVE:  To investigate the effect of different types of sports on pulmonary functions and respiratory muscle strength and to help establish baseline reference values in healthy Turkish boys aged 8–12 years.   METHODS:  A total of 624 healthy boys, who train at least twice a week for football (128), basketball (105), archery (60), swimming (111) and wrestling (74), as well as 146 boys who do not perform regular physical activities voluntarily, participated in the study. To evaluate and potentially differentiate amongst the merits of these several sports, we obtained a variety of baseline measurements from our subjects, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC, maximal peak expiratory flow (PEF max), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP).   RESULTS:  There were statistically significant differences amongst the types of sports regarding the various metrics we examined: FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC, PEF max, MVV, MIP and MEP (p< 0.05). The active boys showed higher mean values for pulmonary functions and respiratory muscle strength than the passive ones. Also, the wrestlers generally had better respiratory parameters than those of athletes in the other four sports we investigated.   CONCLUSIONS:  It was clear that exercise, especially regarding pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength, produced better outcomes in the active boys compared with our control group of relatively passive boys. The mechanisms responsible for this difference are likely due to the resistance effect of exercise."@en ;

The external assistive force might disturb the user’s motor control system during the process of assisted training using power assist suit, thus affect the progress of rehabilitation. With the consideration of the non-negligible physiological differences between upper limbs, this study focused on the physiological responses of the two arms against the external assistive force.   OBJECTIVE:  To investigate and contrast the impact of assistive force on dominant and non-dominant arms during unilateral isometric elbow flexion.   METHODS:  Participants were instructed to adjust force exertion to a target value based on the visual feedback. Task performances including muscle activity of agonist and antagonist muscles, force steadiness and rated perceived exertion were evaluated at multiple workload and assistive load conditions.   RESULTS:  No significant differences in muscle activity of agonist and antagonist muscles between the two arms. In contrast, the dominant arm showed a higher assist efficiency at a low assistive level, whereas the non-dominant arm had a lower level of force fluctuation during a unilateral force matching task.   CONCLUSIONS:  Both arms could utilize the assistive force to reduce muscle activity. However, the two arms showed different abilities in response to external assistive force. This indicates distinct motor control strategies for each arm and implicates the necessity of side-individualized rehabilitative approach for achieving a better training effect."@en ;

OBJECTIVE:  To explore the effects of muscle fatigue on male handball players’ shooting accuracy and ball speed.   METHODS:  Sixteen elite handball players (Mage= 17.1 ± 1.7 years) participated in the laboratory and the field-testing sessions. Running speeds equal to 75% of participants’ maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) values from laboratory tests were used as the initial velocity for the 30–15 intermittent fitness test (30–15IFT) in the fatigue protocol. Participants shot to the target at random visual signals placed behind the target before and after fatigue. In order to measure wrist acceleration and ball speed, an accelerometer and a radar gun are used respectively and numbers of accurate and inaccurate shots also recorded.   RESULTS:  There were no significant differences between pre-fatigue and post-fatigue protocols in terms of accurate and inaccurate shots, and ball speed. Only wrist acceleration in the Y axis (Mpre - fatigue= 33.12, SD = 1.17msec; Mpost - fatigue= 34.50, SD = 1.21msec) was affected by the fatigue protocol in inaccurate shots (p= 0.042).

By introducing computer technology to analyze the efficiency and regularity of sports, not only the characteristics of athletes can be excavated, but also the visibility and dynamic tracking of sport training can be provided. The process of sports education is a fast and complex systematic process. Through the interactive system of physical education, we can use different methods to collect sports data and make a comparative analysis of athletes’ movements. Through the data mining of the relationship between athletes’ physiological indexes and sports load, the unreasonable link in sports training can be avoided. Also, in sports training, we can use computer vision and modern biomechanics to construct a virtual sports education situation. With the classification accuracy as the fitness function, this paper collects the data through the network database, and returns the corresponding sport training parameters on this basis. The results showed that the accuracy of the model was nearly 98%, which met the actual demand.

Generally, self-recovery methods embed two types of data into the original image: check-bits for tamper detection and reference data for image recovery. Generating reference data is the primary challenge of every self-recovery method for more tamper resiliency and higher reconstruction quality. The proposed Multi-Rate Reference Embedding (MRRE) method makes unique reference data with several redundancy rates, instead of generating multiple reference data. According to the proposed methodology, the image is compressed by a source coding algorithm and the compressed data is separated into ten parts. Each part is protected by a channel coding algorithm based on pre-assigned redundancy rates. A fuzzy-based rate allocation system is used to assign the redundancy rates based on the importance of data. The generated data is packetized and randomly embedded into an image block. For tamper detection purpose, check-bits are generated by an MD5 hash function for every block. Both reference data and check-bits are embedded into three least significant bits (LSB) of the image pixels. To increase restoration efficiency, the proposed MRRE method provides ten scales of image recovery named highly-scalable self-recovery. The simulation results show an improvement in both tamper tolerability and reconstruction quality in comparison with the most recent methods."@en ;

Specially, the comprehensive meanings of monotone decreasing and increasing hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms are investigated, in which both explicit and implicit appraisal information are explored to reveal its actual meaning. Additionally, Weibull distribution functions with three parameters are fitted considering the comprehensive meaning of monotone increasing appraisals, which is determined by a multi-objective programming model following ABC classification method. Symmetry principle is employed to confirm the expression of monotone decreasing appraisals, which are transferring from monotone increasing appraisals with same length of domain field. Moreover, feasibility analysis is explored to show the influence of parameters on decision-making precision.

This work proposes an inequality approach to evaluate the performances of DMUs. Inequalities consist of expressions of the production possibility set and the line segments joining the evaluated DMU to the positive output-axes. However, in real-world application involving performance measurement, inputs and outputs are often imprecise and fluctuated. In this case, a fuzzy inequality approach is proposed to evaluate the performances. What is more, fuzzy relative efficiency is dependent upon the number of solutions. Furthermore, the minimal element is used to distinguish the fuzzy relative efficient DMUs. Finally, two numerical examples are used to illustrate the fuzzy approach and compare the results with those obtained with alternative fuzzy approaches."@en ;

In addition, the separation axioms on (semi) topological basic algebras are investigated by considering some conditions implying that a (semi) topological basic algebra becomes a Ti- space, for i ∈ {0, 1, 2}. In the sequel, some relations between (weak) ideals and (weak) filters of basic algebras are obtained and (left) topological (implication) basic algebra is constructed by using the concepts of (weak) filters, which is a zero dimensional, normal, disconnected, locally compact and completely regular (left) topological space. Further, the notion of quotient basic algebras are presented along with evaluating the interaction of topological basic algebras and topological quotient basic algebras. Finally, it is proved that there is an implication basic algebra    IB *    with cardinality n + 1 and filter F* = F ∪ {z*}, which    z *  ∉ IB   for any implication basic algebra   IB   of cardinality n and filter F. Accordingly, it is proved that there is at least one nontrivial regular and normal topological implication basic algebra of cardinality n."@en ;

To deal with the consistency and integrity of the information in the selection process, the aim of this article is to extend the superiority and inferiority ranking method and use the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy theory, where the individual evaluation values and the weights information of criteria and decision-makers are all described by interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. First, some concepts of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set are introduced. Then, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy superiority and inferiority ranking (IVIF-SIR) method is developed. Moreover, an engineering investment selection model based on IVIF-SIR method is investigated. Finally, an illustration of choosing investment alternatives is used to prove the developed approach and a comparative study is also use to demonstrate the effectiveness."@en ;

Adaptive techniques when employed in e-learning can sustain the interest and motivation of the learners and help them to complete the enrolled courses successfully. In addition, it would improve their performance and thus, enhance the overall learning experience. Personalisation takes into consideration the characteristics of the individual learner and the diversity in his/her needs. The main challenge is finding a match between these individual characteristics and the sequence of the learning content. It is a complex task to implement as it involves selection of the appropriate material from a vast amount of the available learning materials. It is a challenge to perform this process manually as it requires both technical savvy and pedagogical skills. In this paper, a stigmergy model is proposed, which was applied to build a customised learning path. The aim was to provide personalisation that satisfied the needs of an individual in a widely heterogeneous e-learning environment. Compared with the traditional teaching method, this tailored learning path, generated using the proposed approach, shows promise and was found to enhance the performance of the learners."@en ;

Firstly, the adaptive strategy is introduced into DE to improve the global search ability in the proposed algorithm. Secondly, the combination of jDE and GOA greatly improves the convergence efficiency while maintaining the population diversity. Finally, it can be observed in the work that the proposed algorithm improves the convergence speed and calculation precision. In the subsequent experiments, 14 well-known test benchmark functions are used to compare the advantages of GOA_jDE. The experimental results illustrate that the performance of proposed algorithm has significant improvement, which also proves the feasibility and effectiveness. Considering the complexity of engineering problems, three classical engineering design problems (tension/compression spring, welded beam, and pressure vessel designs) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. In addition, the classical engineering design results proves the merits of this algorithm in solving real problems with unknown search spaces."@en ;

However, not too much attention has been paid to expert clustering in the LGDM problem under a linguistic environment. Besides, it seems that only the decision information is utilized to group experts while the auxiliary (outside) knowledge (e.g., expertise and occupation) about these experts has not been fully considered during the clustering process. To address this issue, this study proposes a hybrid method integrating outside knowledge about experts with practical preference information under the interval-valued linguistic environment to cluster experts. The method consists of four elements: pre-clustering of experts according to the given knowledge, the optimization model to transform the interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic (IV2TL) decision information, the data envelopment analysis-discriminant analysis (DEA-DA) model to deal with a two-cluster issue, and iterative clustering based on the DEA-DA model to cluster experts into multiple clusters. The feasibility and validity of the proposed method are illustrated with a real-world example. A comparison with the maximal tree clustering method in the linguistic environment is provided."@en ;

Objective: This study aimed to explore the prevalence of cases with AD-related pathology in subjects <40 years of age and to explore the association of such pathology, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and APOE genotype.   Method: We conducted brain immunohistochemistry for 189 cases <40 years of age (mean±standard deviation age 25.3±13.1 years). Tau positive cases were then assessed for the distribution of tau pathology in the locus ceruleus (LC), raphe nucleus (RN), and entorhinal cortex (ErC), and the distinction between neuronal threads and cellular inclusions. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype was also examined.   Results: Tau pathology was detected in 135 cases (71.4%; 13–39 years; only LC, 23 cases; only RN, 4 cases; only ErC, 35 cases; LC+RN, 3 cases; LC+ErC, 57 cases; all three regions, 10 cases). The prevalence of thread pathology was higher than that of cellular inclusions. Significantly higher prevalence of the APOE ɛ2 allele were found in 10–39 years of age natural death cases (p < 0.05). Amyloid-β deposition was found in only 7 cases, along with a significantly high frequency of the ɛ4 allele (p < 0.05). While a past history of psychiatric disease was a significant risk factor for suicide, AD-related pathology was not associated with suicide.   Conclusions: Both the brain stem and entorhinal cortex was the initial site of tau pathology in many younger subjects.

We have found that chronic systemic exposure to lipopolysaccharide of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) induces the accumulation of Aβ in the brain of middle-aged mice. On the other hand, recent research has shown that circulating Aβ is transferred into the brain; however, the involvement of chronic systemic P. gingivalis infection in the peripheral Aβ metabolism is unknown. We hypothesized that chronic P. gingivalis infection expands Aβ pools in peripheral inflammatory tissues and thereby contributes to the accumulation of Aβ in the brain of patients with periodontitis. We showed that the increased expression of IL-1β, AβPP770, CatB, Aβ1-42, and Aβ3-42 was mainly co-localized with macrophages in the liver of P. gingivalis infected mice. Blocking CatB and NF-κB significantly inhibited the P. gingivalis-induced expression of IL-1β, AβPP770, Aβ1-42, and Aβ3-42 in RAW264.7 cells. Aβ3-42, but not Aβ1-42, induced the significant death of macrophages, and the reduction of phagocytic abilities induced by Aβ3-42 tended to be higher than that induced by Aβ1-42. Additionally, the expression of AβPP770, CatB, Aβ1-42, and Aβ3-42 was determined in the macrophages of gingival tissues from periodontitis patients. These findings indicate that chronic systemic P. gingivalis infection induces the Aβ accumulation in inflammatory monocytes/macrophages via the activation of CatB/NF-κB signaling, thus suggesting monocytes/macrophages serve as a circulating pool of Aβ in patients with periodontitis. Taken together, CatB may be a novel therapeutic target for preventing the periodontitis-related AD initiation and pathological progression."@en ;

Good evidence suggests that dementia risk is increased among widowed individuals; however, it is not clear if they are being diagnosed in routine primary care.   Objective: This study aimed to investigate if bereavement influenced the probability of having received a dementia diagnosis.   Methods: A population-based cohort study using UK electronic health records, between 1997 and 2017, among 247,586 opposite-sex partners. Those experiencing partner bereavement were matched (age, sex, and date of bereavement) to a non-bereaved person living in a partnership. Multivariate cox regression was performed.   Results: Partner bereavement was associated with an increased risk of receiving a diagnosis of dementia in the first three months (hazard ratio (HR) 1.43, 95% CI 1.20–1.71) and first six months (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.09–1.41), while there was a small reduced risk of getting a dementia diagnosis over all follow-up (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89–0.98).   Conclusions: Partner bereavement appears to lead to a short-term increased risk of the surviving partner receiving a diagnosis of dementia, suggesting that bereavement unmasks existing undiagnosed dementia. Over the longer term, however, bereaved individuals are less likely to have a diagnosis of dementia in their health records than non-bereaved individuals."@en ;

The role of USP13 is largely unknown in neurodegeneration. In this study we aim to demonstrate whether tau accumulation and/or clearance depends on ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination via USP-13. We used transgenic animal models of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) or P301L tau mutations and genetically knocked-down USP13 expression via shRNA to determine USP13 effects on tau ubiquitination and levels. We found a two-fold increase of USP13 levels in postmortem Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains. USP13 knockdown significantly increased the activity of the 20S proteasome and reduced the levels of hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in primary cortical neurons. USP13 knockdown also reduced the levels of amyloid and increased p-tau ubiquitination and clearance in transgenic animal models that overexpress murine tau as a result of the expression of familial APP mutations (TgAPP) and the human mutant P301L tau (rTg4510), respectively. Clearance of p-tau appears to be mediated by autophagy in these animal models. Taken together, these data suggest that USP13 knockdown reduces p-tau accumulation via regulation of ubiquitination/de-ubiquitination and mediates its clearance via autophagy and/or the proteasome. These results suggest that USP13 inhibition may be a therapeutic strategy to reduce accumulation of plaques and toxic p-tau in AD and human tauopathies."@en ;

For this purpose, AD-mice (amyloid-β intracerebroventricularly injected) were treated intravenously (IV) with fresh human isolated mitochondria. One to two weeks later, a significantly better cognitive performance was noticed in the mitochondria treated AD-mice relative to vehicle treated AD-mice, approaching the performance of non-AD mice. We also detected a significant decrease in neuronal loss and reduced gliosis in the hippocampus of treated mice relative to untreated AD-mice. An amelioration of the mitochondrial dysfunction in brain was noticed by the increase of citrate-synthase and cytochrome c oxidase activities relative to untreated AD-mice, reaching activity levels of non-AD-mice. Increased mitochondrial activity was also detected in the liver of mitochondria treated mice. No treatment-related toxicity was noted.

Circulating currents in parallel connected conductors in transformer windings are a critical design aspect to be analyzed. This article presents a new methodology for the fast calculation of circulating currents for parallel connected conductors in power transformers. The formulation for solid conductor modeling has been developed using the same calculation strategy as in Semianalytic Integral Method (SAIM) [1], which allows a significant reduction of computational effort. A realistic case study of a 25 MVA transformer was used to validate the proposed methodology. As for the accuracy of the calculations, the comparison of the results obtained by the proposed methodology and those calculated using the Finite Element Method (FEM) shows an excellent agreement between both approaches. However, the computational performance of the new approach was found to be much higher than that of FEM. This makes the proposed method much more efficient for transformer design purposes."@en ;

Moreover, the overhang effect was investigated for different overhang structures. Because the AFPM motor has an enlarged form along radial direction, the leakage flux and the saturation effect are considerably different at inner and outer radius of the stator. Therefore, inner and outer overhang part could have different overhang effects. This can lead to the optimization problem with optimal overhang length. Because the AFPM motor requires 3D finite element analysis from its 3D structure, an efficient optimization algorithm is required for optimal overhang structure. In order to increase the convergence speed of the optimization algorithm, this paper proposed the gradient assisted contour method."@en ;

Therefore, identifying the factors that affect the formability of Mg alloy is highly important. In this study, forming limits of Mg alloy sheet under electromagnetic forming (EMF) condition were analyzed at different temperatures based on the Johnson–Cook constitutive model and the failure model. The complete forming limit diagrams of AZ31 Mg alloy at different temperatures and high strain rates were established. The effects of voltage, capacitance, and temperature on the forming limit of AZ31 Mg alloy under EMF were systematically investigated. Results showed that increased discharge voltage and temperature can effectively improve the EMF limit of Mg alloy.

First, the concept of the free-boundary equilibrium problem is studied. Based on the non-rigid plasma model, a free-boundary equilibrium solver developed in MATLAB software is presented to calculate the flux distribution and plasma profile of EAST plasma equilibrium, and the results are validated against the experiments. Second, given a typical double-null plasma equilibrium, the responses of plasma shape to the lower PF coil currents are computed using the orthogonal test method. The dependences of the elongation and triangularity of plasma shape on PF coil currents are obtained, showing that the currents in PF6 and PF8 have the greatest impact on triangularity and elongation for lower single-null (LSN) divertor configuration, respectively. And for double-null (DN) divertor plasma configuration, PF5 and PF7 play equally important roles due to the up-down symmetry. The conclusions will be useful for the design of EAST plasma shape feedback control."@en ;

It is a promising solution for the room temperature processing of lightweight alloy. Coil design is important to energy efficiency and forming performance of EMF. In order to clarify the effect of the equivalent radius of the drive coil on the forming performance, a simulation study is conducted. The preliminary experiment results show good agreement with results of the simulation, and prove the reliability of the simulation model. Then the process of the electromagnetic sheet free bulging is simulated and analyzed. It is found that the combined action of the boundary constraint and the inertia effect will influence the maximum forming depth. And the maximum values can be obtained at different systems when the ratio of the equivalent coil radius to the active workpiece radius is about 0.68."@en ;

Neural network is easy to be identified with available training algorithm, but it cannot directly describe the multi-valued mapping of hysteresis. A neural-Preisach model was proposed for modeling and control of piezoelectric stack actuators. The neural-Preisach model inherits the advantages of Preisach model and neural network, which can describe the hysteresis and update parameters by training algorithm. A feedforward controller was designed with the inverse neural-Preisach model, and then experiments of tracking control were performed to validate the effectiveness of the neural-Preisach model. The maximal error, in case of feedforward and PID controller, is reduced by 83.97%, comparing with the case without control. This indicates that control accuracy with hysteresis compensation is greatly improved compared to that without hysteresis compensation."@en ;

OBJECTIVE: This work assessed the influence of different drying methods: freeze drying (FD), convective drying (CD), vacuum drying (VD), sun drying (SD), and infrared drying (IRD) on the antimicrobial activity of murta berries against four microbial species.   METHODS: Murta berries were subjected to five drying methods. Measurement of bioactive compounds that include: phenolic compounds by HPLC, total flavonoid content by a spectrophotometric method; and anthocyanins by HPLC–MS. Determination of antioxidant capacity by DPPH and ORAC methods and antimicrobial activity by means of agar well diffusion assay.   RESULTS: Murta extracts obtained by FD and CD showed the highest antimicrobial activity, with Staphylococcus aureus the most susceptible species. Drying induced a significant loss of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity although minimal losses were observed in FD, CD and VD extracts. In these extracts, the abundance of bioactive compounds correlated with the antimicrobial activity. Eight phenolic compounds were identified in murta extracts where pyrogallol’s abundance increased in all dried samples.   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that murta dried with FD, CD and VD have the highest potential to be used as a functional ingredient in the food industry."@en ;

Since WSNs typically have no infrastructure, one of the challenges in WSNs is the lack of appropriate method for an operator to interact with the WSN. Practical tasks for WSNs require sensor node adaptive to changes in WSN configuration, user input, and commands hence, monitoring and interaction with the WSN is needed. In this paper, a new scheme for configuration dissemination with monitoring of sensor state is proposed to control dynamically sensor node operation in real time. Moreover, a method is provided for the operator to observe the state of the sensor node, which helps the operator provide an appropriate control input to the WSN. We prove the stability properties of the proposed algorithm and show the simulation results."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Although 3D video has become popular, successful 3D video streaming over wireless networks involves a number of challenges. Due to the frequent frame damages and losses in wireless networks, temporal asynchrony occurs and results in serious visual fatigue for viewers. In order to provide higher quality 3D video, this paper proposes a new scheme termed the Temporal Synchronization Scheme (TSS) for live 3D video streaming. TSS delivers video frames for the left and right views in the same frame sequence with the same transmission priority, and it compensates for frame damage and losses during the decoding phase. In addition, a new metric called the Stereoscopic Temporal Variation Index (STVI) is proposed; it measures the degree of temporal asynchrony in 3D video. Subjective assessments demonstrate that STVI is an objective metric for measuring subjective quality given that it exhibits a strong positive correlation with the subjective MOS rating. This paper demonstrates that TSS significantly improves the visual quality of 3D videos given the use of STVI and the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) even when frame damage and losses occur. The contributions of the paper are as follows: i) The proposed TSS is the first scheme to address the temporal asynchrony issue in live 3D video streaming over wireless networks. ii) TSS only requires slight modifications to decoders. iii) A new metric (i.e., STVI) is proposed to measure the degree of temporal asynchrony in 3D videos. Therefore, 3D video streaming over wireless networks can be performed with temporal synchronization, and it is expected using TSS will reduce visual fatigue."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Approximate Membership Query (AMG) data structures are widely used in the networking area recently. The most popular AMQ data structures are Bloom, Quotient and Cuckoo Filter (CF). The CF is more efficient than the Quotient and Bloom filters in term of the lookup time and false positive rate. An issue in CF is utilization of two hash functions in the query phase that increases the lookup time. Another issue is the relocation loop problem in the programming phase that attempts to find an empty bucket for the collied items. In this paper, a new approach called Single-hash Lookup Cuckoo Filter (SLCF) using one hash function to lookup an item is proposed. In the programming phase, SLCF utilizes a sequence of hash functions without any relocation to find an empty bucket and storing the overflowed items. It finds a bucket with an empty place and sets an index in the original bucket to the address of found bucket. To accelerate the query phase, a handle as a tiny part of the fingerprint is placed in conjunction with the index value in the bucket. In the query phase, only one hash function is used and if the queried item cannot be found in the bucket, the handle is investigated to membership checking. Otherwise, the second bucket pointed by the index is accessed. The simulation results for name search in the named data networking demonstrate that the lookup time is improved 27% for 16 million names in comparison to CF."@en ;

Also, we size the extent to which employees’ years of experience can moderate those relations. Questionnaire responses derived from employees in Chinese technology-driven firms were used to perform the statistical analysis and test the hypotheses drawn in this study. The individual’s engagement in cooperative behaviors was proven to be rather unbiased among colleagues. Likewise, those dynamics led to positive perceptions of trust among them and added to the innovation capability of firms while an individual’s years of experience didn’t influence those dynamics. The present article examined two knowledge-sharing approaches used to ease cooperative behaviors among staff members. However, it is also necessary to examine the influence of other approaches in order to generate more precise comparisons of the frameworks that can yield better results. It is suggested that Chinese firms adopt a more reflexive learning approach that would facilitate individual’s engagement in cooperative behavior that lead to innovation. These results can be useful for managers in industries such as software-engineering and product-design which depend heavily on the effective transmission of knowledge among staff."@en ;

The activity of petroleum ether, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate and methanol extract of algae belonging to Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta were examined against pathogenic bacteria. The crude extract of algae evoked several patterns of antibacterial activities. The petroleum ether extract of Gracilaria multipartita, Ulva reticulata and Sargassum marginatum collected in spring recorded the maximum inhibitory activity against Bacillus subtilis (14–25 mm), MRSA (24–35 mm) and Staphylococcus aureus (14–18 mm), respectively. However, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae were highly inhibited by petroleum ether extract of G. multipartita collected in spring (17–24 mm and 15–19 mm, respectively). Pseudomonas aeruginosa recorded the greatest zone of inhibition (18–22 mm) by the petroleum ether extract of S. marginatum gathered during winter. The MICs values for bacteria were ranged between 1.00–2.75 μg/ml. The chemical composition of the most effective algae extract against pathogenic bacteria was performed by GC-MS and 1H-NMR analysis. The major components of extract were hydrocarbons, carotene derivatives, fatty acids and sterols. The present finding revealed that the tested algae can be used as possible natural source of antibacterial compounds."@en ;

Their growth and PHB production after 7, 14 and 21 days in BG11 medium were determined. The highest dry weight for the isolates was observed at stationary phase (14 days) and PHB accumulation (%, w/w of dry cells) increased with increasing dry weight up to 14 days, then a decline was observed after 21 days. At the stationary phase, cells of O. salina, A. cylindrica and N. linckia accumulated PHB up to 13.62, 11.88 and 10.03% (w/w of dry cells), respectively. The pH values between 8 and 9 were preferred for PHB accumulation. O. salina, A. cylindrica and N. linckia accumulated the highest PHB 17.31, 15.22 and 14.95%, respectively at pH 8. Nitrogen and phosphorus starvation were found stimulatory for PHB accumulation and he highest PHB production was recorded for O. salina, 20.41 and 26.32%, respectively after 14 days of incubation. Electron microscopic analyses of O. salina cells showed the bioplastic accumulation in granule-like structures which was extracted and studied using IRFT analysis.

METHODS: In this randomized single-blind pilot study, we randomly allocated patients affected by progressive MS reporting a reduced use of one upper limb into two different groups: CIMT group (less affected limb blocked by a splint) and control group (undergoing bi-manual treatment). Primary outcome was CIMT safety. Furthermore, we assessed CIMT effects through clinical outcomes (hand grip strength, HGS, and 9 Hole Peg Test, 9HPT) and 3D kinematic analysis (normalized jerk, number of movement units, going phase duration, mean velocity, endpoint error). All evaluations were performed at baseline (T0) and after 2 weeks of treatment (T1) for both arms in both groups.   RESULTS: Ten MS patients, mean aged 51.0±7.7 years, were randomly allocated in the 2 groups. After treatment, no differences were found in the blocked arm.

OBJECTIVE:  To identify candidate miRNAs in Granulosa Cells (GCs) of PCOS and evaluate their potential values for PCOS diagnosis.   METHODS:  We screened differentially expressed miRNAs in GCs between PCOS and controls by the microarray data from the GEO database. GCs were collected from 21 controls and 24 PCOS. The candidate miRNAs were verified by qRT-PCR. The correlation was investigated between candidate miRNAs and clinical characteristics in participants. Diagnostic value of candidate miRNAs was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.   RESULTS:  Seven miRNAs were differentially expressed in PCOS compared with controls. Furthermore, the validation results demonstrated that hsa-miR-3188 and hsa-miR-3135b showed higher levels in GCs with PCOS patients (p< 0.05).

METHODS:  Using PVA-H or myocardium ablation tissue models under conditions of no flow, electrode and tissue temperatures and lesion sizes were measured at various vibrational frequencies and contact force conditions.   RESULTS:  The experiments showed that the catheter vibration still decreases the electrode temperature over a contact force range of 2–30 gf.

OBJECTIVE: We propose an approach centered on the involvement of workers at all hierarchical levels around “intermediary objects” of prevention in order to foster a collective debate. This might provide empowered workers to be actors into their own prevention of risk faced.   METHODS: Observational data was coupled with chemical and physiological measurements. We developed, reworked and enriched the notion of risk representation, which promotes the visibility and recognition of the knowledge built, developed and held by workers on their activities and on ways to protect themselves from dangers or hazards.   RESULTS: Implementation of the method generates detailed knowledge of chemical risks, knowledge that is constructed by the workers. This knowledge is made possible by the experience of the body and senses, and becomes accessible via references to the domestic and professional sphere in reflexive activities. The actors get involved and make use of their individual, collective and organizational resources to propose prevention solutions   CONCLUSIONS: Use of intermediate prevention objects in an “intermediate space for dialogue” allows dialogues to be produced and fostered.

In Korea, desks and chairs for primary schools have seven different height levels, and these levels are regulated by the national standard KSG-2010. These levels serve to accommodate children of all heights, but the choice problem remains because of the many alternatives.   OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the anthropometric feasibility of the currently used guidelines for the selection of height level for Korean primary school furniture. In addition, we examine children’s ability to select anthropometrically recommendable desk and seat heights.   METHODS: In study 1, anthropometric data from 2005 Korean children were acquired and a mismatch analysis was performed under the assumption that children were paired with the height level recommended by the guidelines. In study 2, we conducted a desk and seat height selection experiment that included 36 children.   RESULTS: The results of study 1 revealed that about three quarters of children could be matched by following the guidelines. The results of study 2 showed that a quarter of children selected matchable desk and seat heights by themselves. We developed new guidelines using classification algorithms based on the employed data in study 1, and it was confirmed that the new guidelines could significantly increase the degree of match.   CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that the currently used guidelines need to be revised and that children had difficulty in selecting the appropriate height of school furniture by themselves. The new guidelines suggested in this study are expected to contribute to the correct usage by Korean primary school children."@en ;

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to identify work accommodations that are available and that are provided to individuals with mental disorders. In addition, associated cost-effectiveness and cost-benefits of these accommodations are examined.   METHODS: Studies published between 1990–2016 from four databases were reviewed. From these databases, studies that specified accommodations that were available/provided and/or addressed cost-effectiveness or cost-benefit analysis of work accommodations were included.   RESULTS: Of the 1362 eligible studies, only 15 were included. Work accommodations that were provided to individuals assisted in mitigating limitations in the work place and improved length of job tenure, as well as reduced the severity of certain mental disorders. The costs associated with these accommodations were found to be minimal and had positive economic benefits for employers.   CONCLUSION: Work accommodations help individuals with mental disorders meet employment expectations with minimal cost."@en ;

Globally and annually, at least 10 million individuals live with TBI that is serious enough to result in death or hospitalisation   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore and describe the experiences of women with traumatic brain injury, in their work environments utilising the Model of Occupational Self-efficacy as a vocational rehabilitation approach   METHOD: Ten females with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury participated in the study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and data were analysed utilising a qualitative approach to elucidate themes. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with two occupational therapists who served as key informants.   RESULTS: Two themes emerged depicting the participants’ experiences and perceptions of barriers and facilitators which influenced their return to work: (1) Barriers to work participation for women with TBI, 2) Re-establishing a worker identity by means of vocational rehabilitation.   CONCLUSION: Both personal and environmental factors emerged as hindrances to returning to work for women with traumatic brain injury. Vocational rehabilitation proved successful in establishing a worker identity amongst participants; however, particular focus should be placed on the function-dysfunction continuum of the process of work place integration to further develop and enhance sustainable return to work programmes for women with traumatic brain injury."@en ;

For optimal success, however, innovative approaches that appeal to employees are needed.   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the physical activity levels and experiences of university staff members who walked shelter dogs during their lunch breaks.   METHOD: Participants walked with a dog and a partner for 30 minutes during their lunch break one day a week for four weeks. Accelerometer data was collected during participant walks and interviews conducted post-intervention.   RESULTS: Quantitative results indicated that participants averaged 24.9±7.4 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (range 12– 37 min) during the walk. Qualitative findings suggested that the incorporation of shelter dogs into a walking intervention encouraged participants to take part in the study and continue each week.   CONCLUSIONS: Both the quantitative and qualitative data from this pilot study support the notion that including shelter dogs into a university-based walking program encouraged physical activity engagement and adherence."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: Psychological conditions are experiences of the conscious and unconscious elements of the work context, which revolve around workers’ perceptions of feeling either engaged or disengaged with the assigned tasks. In the psychosocial work environment of hazardous industries like petrochemicals where production lasts twenty-four hours a day and continues seven-days-a-week, a psychologically available worker is extremely important. Psychological availability refers to when workers who are physically, emotionally and psychologically engaged at the moment of performing tasks.   OBJECTIVE: The broad objective of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect effects of behavioral factors on the psychological and physiological health of workers.   METHODS: The latest, second generation technique, which is structural equation modeling, is used to identify the relationships between behavioral antecedents and health outcomes. A total of 277 technical workers participated, aged between 20 and 49 and were healthy in all aspects.   RESULTS: The study results showed quantitative demands, emotional demands, work-family conflict, and job insecurity were significantly associated with both psychological (stress) and physiological (Body Mass Index) factors. The social support of colleagues produced mixed findings with direct and indirect paths. Stress also significantly mediates the psychosocial factors and burnout of the workers.   CONCLUSION: The study concluded that workers were physically available, but they experienced distractions as members of social systems, affecting their physiological and psychological health."@en ;

Existing field or laboratory studies showed that standing interventions are not a detriment to work productivity or performance. The effect of gradient standing proportion on these measures is still unknown.   OBJECTIVE: The current naturalistic pilot study aimed to examine the controlled sit-stand ratio effect on office performances.   METHODS: Eleven musculoskeletal symptom free office employees from a large government agency volunteered in this study. They were all equipped with electronic sit-stand desks. Computer usage (N=11) and productivity (N=3) were collected using software and organizational metrics, respectively, for four typical workdays of four different sit-stand ratios (7 : 1, 3 : 1, 2 : 1, and 1 : 1).   RESULTS: There were no statistically significant schedule effects on any computer usage measures. While not significant, time using computer, keystrokes, word count, and keyboard errors were all less as standing time increased. Sit-stand ratio and job productivity did not observe a clear cause and effect relationship.   CONCLUSIONS: The amount of time spent standing in typical office jobs might not affect computer usage and productivity. Further study with a larger sample is needed for a stronger evidence."@en ;

The employability assessment model was developed a decade ago by rehabilitation counselors and has not been critically examined.   OBJECTIVE: This exploratory descriptive study aims to elicit key issues of employability assessment within Australian life insurance.   METHODS: Ten rehabilitation advisors with knowledge of employability assessment in the total and permanent disability sector participated in a single focus group. They each nominated issues of concern about employability assessment. These issues were collated then discussed within the group. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to identify key issues.   RESULTS: The predominant theme was the forensic nature of employment evidence. There were three categories of key issues. First, assessment providers— their training, qualifications, experience, and role. Second, methodology— approaches that provide most realistic information about a claimant’s likelihood of work. Third, policy definitions that illustrate reliance on legal interpretation of employability.   CONCLUSIONS: To withstand legal scrutiny, the credentials of providers, assessment methodology, and quality of forensic reports are key issues which need to be addressed. This foundational study will contribute to broader research on this topic, with implications particularly for rehabilitation, life insurance, and claimants."@en ;

The aim of the present study was to evaluate possible sensorimotor gating deficits in the Tg4-42 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease using the prepulse inhibition task (PPI). Previous studies indicated that the hippocampus is essentially involved in the regulation of PPI. We analyzed 7-month-old homozygous Tg4-42 mice as mice at this age display severe neuron loss especially in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Our results revealed a reduced startle response and PPI in Tg4-42 mice. The observed deficits in startle response and PPI are likely due to altered sensory processing abilities rather than hearing deficits as Tg4-42 displayed intact hearing in the fear conditioning task. The present study demonstrates for the first time that sensorimotor gating is impaired in Tg4-42 mice. Analyzing startle response as well as the PPI may offer valuable measurements to assess the efficacy of therapeutic strategies in the future in this Alzheimer’s disease model."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "A runoff is a multi-factor phenomenon being of great importance in the life of humans, animals and plants. Rivers are known to meet the needs of biota and economic activity in fresh water. A channel runoff represents constantly replenished resources of self-purification capacity. This makes it almost the only source that provides the needs of industry, agriculture as well as housing and public utility sector in water of the required quality. The ecological situation of the territory and the extent to which natural complexes are changed due to the increased technogenic processes resulting in the depletion of the channel runoff and transformation of its regime, depend on the state of water bodies. This paper presents the study of the runoff formation factors and the role of economic activities in changing the water volume of rivers. Statistical methods and data on human activities within river basins were used in establishing the starting point of changes in the hydrological characteristics and determining the degree of the runoff change. Rivers with disrupted runoff regime were identified; changes in annual and seasonal runoff were assessed. The role of hydraulic engineering construction and irrigation reclamation facilities in the dynamics of hydrologic processes as the main factors of changes in the water volume of river systems was grounded. The study results can be used in water management calculations to restore runoff values, in construction of economic facilities in catchments and riverbeds, as well as in adjustment of water management circuits for industrial enterprises and settlements."@en ;

The study about macro benthos was carried out in a canal of south-eastern coast of Bangladesh with some physico-chemical parameters of water and soil during post and pre-monsoon seasons. The canal originates from hilly areas and opens into the Bay of Bengal. Polychaetes were the most abundant group followed by Oligocheates Bivalves crabs during post-monsoon. Oligocheates were the most abundant group followed by Polychaetes, Bivalves during pre-monsoon. Salinity showed positive significant relationship with the Polycheates and as well as Phosphate-Phosphorus. A negative significant relationship was found between Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Oligocheates abundance in the investigated canal and a positive relationship was found between Total Suspended Solids and Oligocheates abundance. There was no relationship among the parameters of water as well as soil and crab abundance. The abundance of macro benthos is useful indicators of the condition of the canal and of the canal habitat as a whole. The effect of anthropogenic induced stressors had resulted in an unstable physically controlled environment characterized by a low density of macrobenthos."@en ;

Recent findings: There have been advancements in understanding the genetic composition and biochemical behavior of CIS. Technological advancements including Photodynamic Diagnosis (PDD) with Hexaminolevulinate (HVA) better detect CIS compared to traditional white light (WL) cystoscopy. Recently published single and multi-center studies have enabled better understanding of the impact of CIS on clinical and cancer related outcomes, including disease recurrence and patient survival. Alternative intravesical chemotherapeutic and immunotherapies for CIS have been investigated, especially in the setting of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) unresponsive disease. While these demonstrate a great deal of promise, they have not garnered much success.   Summary: The genetics of CIS is linked to aggressive, and at times resistant disease, with increased cancer progression and associated clinically worse cancer specific outcomes. New technologies have enabled a more effective diagnosis of CIS. The development of a standardized definition for clinical trials and greater disease understanding will enable us to develop better treatment options."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND:  Changes in the motor control of the spine were found in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Sudden loading of the spine is supposed to be the cause of about 12% of lower back injuries. However, some aspects of this problem, such as alterations in the sensory-motor control of the spine, remain questionable.   OBJECTIVE:  To investigate the effects of familiarization with loading, weight and size of loading on neuromuscular responses during sudden upper limb loading in CLBP patients.   METHODS:  In this quasi-experimental study surface electromyography of the erector spinae (ES) and transverses abdominis/internal oblique (TrA/IO) and external oblique (EOA) muscles were recorded in 7 men and 13 women with CLBP and 20 asymptomatic subjects (10 men and 10 women) aged 18–45 years from the general community familiarization. Moreover, investigating control of the posture measurements of the center of pressure (COP) and vertical ground reaction force (GRF) or Fz were recorded using a force plate. Data were analyzed using paired t-test and independent t-test with the significance level of 0.05.   RESULTS:  Data analyses were performed using SPSS version 18. Some electromyography and force plate variables were significantly different for different conditions in each group and between the asymptomatic and low back pain groups (p⩽ 0.05).   CONCLUSION:  Several motor control changes were observed in the CLBP patients. These patients showed decreased trunk muscle activity as well as too early and too delayed responses compared to asymptomatic subjects."@en ;

Q angle (QA) has shown to be a predictor for lower extremity injuries. However, the relationship between balance and QA has not been investigated in young adults.   OBJECTIVE:  The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between QA and balance in young adults.   METHODS:  Ninety participants performed the single leg stance test (SLST) and Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) to assess static and dynamic balance, respectively. QA was measured using a manual goniometer. Participants were divided into low, normal and high QA groups.   RESULTS:  The relationship between SLST and QA was not statistically significant in both eyes opened and closed condition (r=-0.030, p= 0.782; r= 0.031, p= 0.774; respectively). SLST scores did not differ among the three groups in both eyes opened and closed condition (p= 0.781, p= 0.790; respectively). QA significantly correlated with lateral, posterolateral directions and sum score of SEBT (r= 0.240, p= 0.023; r= 0.269, p= 0.010; r= 0.210, p= 0.047). The comparisons among the low, normal and high Q angle groups’ SEBT scores showed that balance performance in lateral direction was poorer in low QA group (p= 0.027).   CONCLUSIONS:  The results of the study showed that QA and dynamic balance have a significant relationship. To reduce musculoskeletal injury risk, the dynamic balance should be assessed in young adults who have lower QA."@en ;

Therefore, it is vital to investigate what significance lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA) has in this context.   OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the short- and long-term results as well as the most important factors that can improve outcomes after LVA.   METHODS: This study includes a complete data set of 26 patients who received LVA for a therapy-resistant lymphedema. Patients were followed up for an average of 23 months.   RESULTS: 50% of the patients reported a subjective improvement. Without conservative treatment after the operation the patients showed significant better results (100% vs. 40.9%, p = 0.030). The localization of lymphedema as well as the region of LVA had a significant influence. In patients with lymphedema affecting the entire leg, symptom improvement was significantly lower (35.3% vs. 77.8%, p = 0.039). Patients who received LVA in an upper limb show a significantly higher improvement in symptoms than patients who received LVA in a lower limb (100% vs. 30%, p = 0.021).   CONCLUSIONS: We identified factors with a significant influence on the outcome of patients after receiving LVA.

Therefore, a new non-invasive hyperspectral camera (TIVITA® Tissue) was tested in patients with and without PAD.   OBJECTIVE: It was hypothesized that the oxygenation parameters of the TIVITA® Tissue correlate to established modalities for detection of PAD and allow differentiation between individuals with and without PAD.   METHODS: Evaluation of tissue oxygenation was performed in the angiosome of the medial plantar artery in 25 healthy young people and in 24 patients with and 25 patients without PAD in comparable age. Thereby, superficial oxygenation (StO2) and near-infrared (NIR) perfusion index were measured with the TIVITA® Tissue. Additionally, the ankle-brachial-index (ABI), the complaint free walking distance and the vascular quality of life were assessed and demographic data were obtained from all participants.   RESULTS: TIVITA® Tissue analysis revealed significantly reduced StO2 and NIR perfusion index in PAD compared to healthy young participants and patients without PAD. StO2 and NIR perfusion index positively correlated with ABI, the complaint free walking distance and the vascular quality of life score.

As research gets ever more global and new countries and institutions, either from academia or corporate environments, start to contribute, it is important to monitor this complex phenomenon and understand its dynamics and equilibria. We present a study on a conference proceedings dataset extracted from Springer Nature SciGraph that illustrates insightful geographical trends and highlights the unbalanced growth of competitive research institutions worldwide in the 1996–2016 period. The main contribution of this work is fourfold. In the first instance, we found that the distributions of institutions and publications among countries follow a power law, consistently with previous literature, i.e., very few countries keep producing most of the papers accepted by high-tier conferences. Secondly, we show how the turnover rate of country rankings is extremely low and steadily declines over time, suggesting an alarmingly static landscape in which new entries struggle to emerge. We also performed an analysis of the venue locations and their effect on the distribution of countries involved in the publications, underlining the central role of Europe and China as knowledge hubs. Finally, we evidence the presence of an increasing gap between the number of institutions initiating and overseeing research endeavours (i.e. first and last authors’ affiliations) and the total number of institutions participating in research. The paper also discusses our experience in working with authors’ affiliations: an utterly simple matter at first glance, that is instead revealed to be a complex research and technical challenge."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND:  The menstrual cycle is the cycle of natural variations that occurs in the uterus and ovary as an essential part of making sexual reproduction possible. It is characterized by hormonal changes but the changes that occur in some active phase reactants (APR) parameters have not been fully elucidated.   OBJECTIVE:  The aim of this study was to compare the serum albumin, ESR, and C-reactive protein levels in follicular and luteal phases of menstruation.   METHODS:  A total of 90 healthy regularly menstruating women where used for this study. Forty-five of the study participants were in their follicular phase while the other 45 where in their luteal phase. Four milliliters of blood were withdrawn from each patient under aseptic condition and two milliliters was dispensed into EDTA container while the other two milliliters were dispensed into a plane container. The EDTA anticoagulated blood was used for ESR and full blood count while the serum from the plain tubes was used for analysis of C-reactive protein and Serum Albumin. Sysmex K-3 auto-analyser (Sysmex, Kobe Japan) was used for te determination of full blood count, the Westergren method was used for ESR estimation, Bromo Cresyl Green method was used for serum albumin and ELISA method was used for CRP determination. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 23.   RESULTS:  This study showed a statistically significant difference in the ESR (p= 0.03) among menstruating women in the follicular and luteal phases of menstruation. Sociodemographic factors had no statistically significant effect on the APR parameters of menstruating women in the follicular and luteal phases of menstruation (p> 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between acute phase proteins of menstruating women in the follicular phase and luteal phases (p> 0.05). Also, age and marital status did not affect the acute phase proteins among menstruating women in the follicular phase and luteal phases (p> 0.05).   CONCLUSIONS:  There is need to generate data on menstrual disorders and their impact on women’s health status, quality of life and social integration. It is vital that evaluation and treatment of menstrual complaints should be given a higher priority in primary care programs. There is need to invest in public enlightenment program to increase awareness in secondary schools to increase the level of awareness among adolescents as well as young females."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND:  Drought is a serious issue which might be caused by climate change that could create famine and health problems. Drought reduces air quality, increases fungal infestation, reduces people hand washing, affects mental health, leads to malnutrition by decreasing agricultural production, and increases diseases transmitted by insects. This study aimed to determine and describe community health status through building drought resilience in Ethiopia.   METHODS:  This review was conducted based on the available peer-reviewed articles that were published from January 2004 to December 2018 Online databases from PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched for studies related to the building drought and community health resilience at different regions of Ethiopia that were published in English language. The search was made by using “Emergency disaster”, “prevention”, “preparedness”, “response”, “recovery”, “drought”, “food insecurity”, “coping strategies” and “drought health policy” as keywords.   RESULTS:  Most of the reviewed articles deal with the impact of climate change on the human health in relation to food security. The associated factors of the impact of drought on food security is basically due to lack of irrigation and farmland, the scarcity of water due to the direct effect of drought, flood, severe soil erosion, livestock dispossession, family size of the household and literacy of the households. Various coping strategies were employed by the households to alleviate the high and continued food insecurity problem such as reducing the number and amount of meal, scrounging cash and grain, searching for off-farm and non-farm jobs, getting food aid, vending of livestock, and partake in food for work programs.   CONCLUSION:  The findings explored components of the coping strategies to the building resilience create fruitful health conditions for the food insecure household. The effect of agricultural support services as reliance’s on drought and community health situation was regarded as a positive outcome. Moreover, the means to get adequate food security strategies in all regions of Ethiopia should be designed. Furthermore, future researches are recommended for finding the best building strategies for each region of Ethiopia."@en ;

Although, swimming is a popular sport throughout the world, studies on the effects of warm-up are scarce.   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of different stretching warm-up and exercise protocols on swim performance.   METHODS:  Fourteen sub-elite college women swimmers volunteered to participate in the study. The four stretching and warm-up protocols they followed were; (I) without stretching (WS); (II) static stretch (SS); (III) in-water (IW); and (IV) dry land (DL).   RESULTS: There was a significant main effect for 50-meter front crawl (F = 70,453; p= 0.00) and breaststroke swimming performances (F = 145.504; p= 0.000). The best 50-meter front crawl and breaststroke performance detected immediately after IW was 28.1 and next, 39.9 seconds.

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Neurocognitive disorders causing progressive cognitive, functional, and behavioral impairment remain underdiagnosed. The needs for a timely diagnosis are now widely acknowledged since person-centered care helps to preserve life quality and prevent crises. One powerful barrier to detection in primary care is the lack of an easy-to-follow stepwise approach, grounded in evidence and consistent with high-quality specialty practice. To help fill this gap, the current European Joint Action proposes a graduated diagnosis strategy tailored to the patients’ needs and wills, clarifying appropriate components for primary and specialty care. This strategy considers a first evaluation in primary care that may detect a neurocognitive disorder, that would lead to a second evaluation step allowing etiological diagnosis hypotheses performed mostly by the specialist. A third evaluation stage considering some biological, electrophysiological, or neuroimaging complementary techniques would be proposed to atypical cases or patients willing to consider access to research."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: The utility of recognition memory for identifying persons with biomarker evidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is unclear since prior studies of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) relied only on clinical diagnosis and did not include simultaneous measures of central amyloidosis and tauopathy.   Objective: We evaluated whether recognition memory and associated indices, including discriminability and response bias from signal detection theory, differentiate persons with amnestic MCI (aMCI) due to prodromal AD from non-prodromal AD.   Method: Sixty older adults with aMCI were classified as prodromal AD (n = 28) or non-prodromal AD (n = 32) based upon cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-β and tau. Memory was assessed using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised which includes free recall and recognition.   Results: ANCOVAs adjusting for age indicated comparable (all p > 0.05) performances between prodromal and non-prodromal MCI groups respectively on traditional HVLT-R recognition measures of hits (mean±SD: 9.5±3.0 versus 10.9±1.7), false alarms (1.8±1.8 versus 1.5±1.5), and hits minus false alarms (7.7±3.0 versus 9.2±2.6). In contrast, discriminability (d’), which reflects how easily targets and distractors are distinguished, was significantly (p = 0.009) poorer in the prodromal versus non-prodromal groups (3.1±1.9 versus 4.8±2.0, effect size = 0.87). In addition, only d’ significantly predicted group membership (OR = 0.66, CI = 0.48–0.92, p = 0.04). Response bias, the tendency to report that a target did or did not appear, was comparable between groups (0.08±1.1 versus –0.04±1.3).   Conclusion: Recognition discriminability is significantly poorer in aMCI with biomarker evidence of prodromal AD. In contrast to traditional recognition indices, discriminability from signal detection theory may be superior in identifying aMCI due to AD versus non-AD etiologies."@en ;

There is a paucity of randomized controlled trials of interventions supporting people with mild dementia to engage in meaningful and purposeful activity. The aim of this study was to assess whether Behavioral Activation (BA) is an acceptable psychological intervention for people with mild dementia and whether a large-scale trial is feasible. Participants were randomly assigned to BA (n = 42) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 21). BA aimed at increasing engagement in enjoyable and meaningful activity, and preventing low mood. Follow-up was at 3 and 6 months. Assessors were blind to treatment allocation (trial registration number: ISRCTN75503960). Retention rate was above 80% at both assessment time points. Treatment acceptability and credibility were high. Depressive symptoms remained unchanged in both groups. There was evidence of improvement associated with BA for every day function (–3.92, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) –6.87 to –0.97), and engagement in meaningful and enjoyable activity (5.08, 95% CI 0.99 to 9.16) post-treatment (3 months) in comparison to TAU. Both carer-rated patient health-related quality of life (0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.28) and physical health (11.31, 95% CI 2.03 to 20.59) showed evidence of improvement at 3 months. Improvements in meaningful and enjoyable activity were maintained at 6 months. BA for people with mild dementia is feasible and acceptable and may be associated with clinically significant changes in function and quality of life. A full scale randomized controlled trial of clinical effectiveness is now needed."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "The amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) is critical in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), since two-step proteolytic processing of AβPP generates the neurotoxic amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). We developed a dual fluorescence labeling system to study the exact subcellular location of γ-secretase cleavage of AβPP. The C-terminal tail of AβPP was fluorescently labeled using a SNAP-tag, while the Aβ region of AβPP was fluorescently tagged with a dye at a genetically-encoded noncanonical amino acid (ncAA). The ncAA was introduced at specific positions in AβPP using a genetic code expansion strategy and afterwards, the reactive side-chain of the ncAA was coupled to the dye using a bioorthogonal labeling chemistry. In proof-of-concept experiments, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids containing engineered AβPP harboring an amber mutation and an amber codon suppression system with an evolved tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair and grown in the presence of a lysine-derived ncAA. Processing of the AβPP variants was validated with ELISA and immunoblotting, and seven AβPP mutants that showed similar cleavage pattern as wild-type AβPP were identified. The AβPP mutant was fluorescently labeled with 6-methyl-tetrazine-BDP-FL and TMR-Star at the ncAA and SNAP-tag, respectively. Using this approach, AβPP was fluorescently labeled at two sites in living cells with minimal background to allow monitoring of Aβ and C-terminal cleavage products simultaneously. The method described provides a powerful tool to label Aβ with minimal perturbations of its processing, thus enabling studies of the trafficking of the cleavage products of AβPP."@en ;

We investigated whether oral administration of monosodium glutamate (MSG) has effects in a murine model of AD, the double transgenic mice APP/PS1. We found that AD pathogenic factors appear earlier in APP/PS1 when supplemented with MSG, while wildtype mice were essentially not affected. Aβ and p-tau levels were increased in the hippocampus in young APP/PS1 animals upon MSG administration. This was correlated with increased Cdk5-p25 levels. Furthermore, in these mice, we observed a decrease in the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 and they had impaired long-term potentiation. The Hebb-Williams Maze revealed that they had memory deficits. We show here for the first time that oral MSG supplementation can accelerate AD-like pathophysiology in a mouse model of AD."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Alzheimer’s disease is the principal cause of dementia and is determined, in at least one third cases, by modifiable risk factors (MRF). The “Lifestyle for Brain Health (LIBRA)” index was recently developed to quantify the individual risk of progression to dementia ascribable to MRF.   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between LIBRA scores and markers of cognitive performance, functional independence, and psycho-behavioral symptoms in a community-based sample of Italian elders.   Methods: 308 senior participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective cognitive decline (SCD) were evaluated with a complete neuropsychological battery and semi-structured interviews for the assessment of depression, apathy, and functional autonomy. All the 12 LIBRA MRF were available for the calculation of LIBRA scores. A modified version of the index (LIBRA-2) was calculated by removing depression weight from the LIBRA index. Partial correlation analyses, controlling for age and education, assessed the association between LIBRA indices and cognitive, functional, and behavioral outcomes. Separate analyses were repeated in the MCI and SCD subgroups.   Results: In participants with SCD (SCDp), significant correlations existed between LIBRA and markers of impairment in global cognition, visuo-spatial attention, and semantic fluency. LIBRA-2 associated with psycho-behavioral symptoms in the whole sample and in SCDp. LIBRA-2 only associated with apathy in the MCI subgroup.   Conclusions: The LIBRA index might be useful to determine the lifestyle-attributable risk of cognitive and psycho-behavioral decline in Italian seniors at risk, while in those with overt cognitive impairment, these outcomes are presumably mainly associated with non-modifiable factors."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "The Mexican American population is among the fastest growing aging population and has a younger onset of cognitive decline. This group is also heavily burdened with metabolic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Unfortunately, limited research has been conducted in this group. Understanding methylation alterations, which are influenced by both genetic and lifestyle factors, is key to identifying and addressing the root cause for mild cognitive impairment, a clinical precursor for dementia. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on a community-based Mexican American population using the Illumina EPIC array. Following rigorous quality control measures, we identified 10 CpG sites to be differentially methylated between normal controls and individuals with mild cognitive impairment annotated to PKIB, KLHL29, SEPT9, OR2C3, CPLX3, BCL2L2-PABPN1, and CCNY. We found four regions to be differentially methylated in TMEM232, SLC17A8, ALOX12, and SEPT8. Functional gene-set analysis identified four gene-sets, RIN3, SPEG, CTSG, and UBE2L3, as significant. The gene ontology and pathway analyses point to neuronal cell death, metabolic dysfunction, and inflammatory processes. We found 1,450 processes to be enriched using empirical Bayes gene-set enrichment. In conclusion, the functional overlap of differentially methylated genes associated with cognitive impairment in Mexican Americans implies cross-talk between metabolically-instigated systemic inflammation and disruption of synaptic vesicular transport."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are acknowledged stages of the clinical spectrum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and cognitive control seems to be among the first neuropsychological predictors of cognitive decline. Existing tests are usually affected by educational level, linguistic abilities, cultural differences, and social status, constituting them error-prone when differentiating between the aforementioned stages. Creating robust neuropsychological tests is therefore prominent.   Objective: The design of a novel psychometric battery for the cognitive control and attention assessment, free of demographic effects, capable to discriminate cognitively healthy aging, SCD, MCI, and mild Dementia (mD).   Methods: The battery initial hypothesis was tuned using iterations of administration on random sampling healthy older adults and people with SCD, MCI, and mD, from the area of Thessaloniki, Greece. This resulted in the first release of the REflexes MEasurement DEviceS for Alzheimer battery (REMEDES for Alzheimer-R4Alz).   Results: The first release lasts for almost an hour. The battery was design to assess working memory (WM) including WM storage, processing, and updating, enriched by episodic buffer recruitment. It was also designed to assess attention control abilities comprising selective, sustained, and divided attention subtasks. Finally, it comprises an inhibitory control, a task/rule switching or set-shifting, and a cognitive flexibility subtask as a combination of inhibition and task/rule switching abilities.   Conclusion: The R4Alz battery is an easy to use psychometric battery with increasing difficulty levels and assumingly ecological validity, being entertaining for older adults, potentially free of demographic effects, and promising as a more accurate and early diagnosis tool of neurodegeneration."@en ;

The motor contains two part named lateral rotation module and internal deflection modules. The output torque of the motor, the rotation speed and control precision are improved by the coordinated control of rotation movement and deflection movement. The magnetic field shielding and optimization of two modules inside and outside the motor are realized by using Halbach permanent magnet array, and the magnetic field characteristics of the motor are improved. First, using analytical method and finite element method, the magnetic field characteristics and distribution of the permanent magnet of the motor are analyzed, and the electromagnetic characteristics of load and no load condition and output torque of the motor is analyzed by finite element method. Then, the loss of this motor is analyzed and calculated, the motor response surface equation is built by using taguchi method and central composite design method. Finally, the optimal structure parameters of motor is proposed by the numerical model based on maximizing the motor output torque of the target, and it is compared with finite element and experiment to verify the accuracy of the structural parameters. It provides a new theoretical basis for the follow-up optimization of the motor."@en ;

We calculate the magnetostatics field and bulk wave propagation utilizing the finite element method (FEM). We simulate the characteristics of the SV wave, and we find that the radiant distance and propagation direction has a great influence on the amplitude of the displacement of the specimen. The superposition area of SV waves from different sources possesses better focusing ability, and the triangular area (normalized amplitude of the SV waves lower than 10%) near the surface of a specimen should be avoided to be chosen when designing the meander line coils. As for the line-focusing EMAT described in this manuscript, the selection of focal positions for different thickness specimens or detection depth is completely different. Moreover, we perform an experiment to validate the simulation results and lead to a conclusion that the position of the focal point is required to be appropriately close to the excitation coils to enhance the intensity of the signal, while the best focal position should be calculated."@en ;

RESULTS: Of the 51 state plans, 44 contained references to autism, and 19 explicitly identified autism as a disability group that is underserved by the state VR agency. Even among states that clearly defined autism as underserved, only 10 provided comprehensive plans which defined goals and strategies to address the vocational needs of this group. We discuss major themes related to VR service delivery for people with autism identified within the state plans.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to compare sagittal spine deformities among first graders (young and elder school students) in elementary schools.   METHODS: The sagittal spinal curvatures of 45 young school students aged 5–7 years and 50 elder school students aged 9–11 years were examined by using spinal mouse device.   RESULTS: Independent sample t-test shows statistically significant differences in sagittal spinal deformities with increased thoracic kyphosis and spinal flexion in young children than elder children (P = .000, t = 10.72). However, young children show lesser lordosis than elder children (P = .001, t = –4.47). In addition, the young children established a higher significant coefficient of compensation (CC) than elder children (P = .000 t = 12.58).   CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the forward flexion of the trunk is more common among young children than elder children. This may be attributed to differences in postural awareness and way of sitting among students of elementary school.

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: Ergonomics can help instructional designers to develop projects compatible with students’ needs, capabilities, and limitations.   OBJECTIVE: We intend to verify the application of ergonomics in instructional design methods, methodologies, techniques, and recommendations.   METHODS: We searched journal articles in the following databases: Compendex, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science. Based on two inclusion criteria: (1) whether the article presents methods, methodologies, techniques, or recommendations for the instructional design; (2) whether the article addresses issues of ergonomics, we found 17 studies published from 1988 to 2013 in 16 journals.   RESULTS: The main ergonomic concept addressed in the reviewed studies was usability, followed by accessibility, and user-centred design. Most articles suggest guidelines for embedding ergonomics in instructional design.   CONCLUSIONS: We found that future research could explore topics, such as user experience, design thinking, service design, and organisational ergonomics to improve instructional design practice. The number of studies found in this review demonstrates that scientific research should explore the application of ergonomics in instructional design methods."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: Cleaning workers experience severe musculoskeletal symptoms.   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to examine musculoskeletal symptoms in cleaners of different heights to evaluate the effects of height on working postures in the work environment (schools).   METHODS: We used a three-stage method including using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) to evaluate musculoskeletal symptoms, a task analysis to confirm typical cleaning tasks, and the OVAKO Working Posture Assessment System (OWAS) for posture analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to evaluate the adjusted effects of individual characteristics on painful body regions, using individuals without any pain as the reference category.   RESULTS: This study found that the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms is very high for cleaners, especially in the shoulders, elbows, and lower back. Odds ratios for the accumulation of two or more risk factors were higher among men and were inversely associated with national economic indicators. The relatively high prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms may stem from the multiple operations involved in cleaning tasks, such as trash collecting, floor mopping, toilet cleaning, and mirror polishing. Workers of different heights had differential work loadings for different tasks.   CONCLUSIONS: This paper proposes recommendations for job adaptations and occupational safety training. Cleaners of different heights execute the typical tasks via different postures, and awkward postures often result in musculoskeletal symptoms. Cleaners should be provided with specific tools and training regarding working postures on the basis of height. These findings can be used as a reference for related operation designs and task improvements to ensure correct tool usage and safer working postures during cleaning."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "The mechanical properties of electrospun fiber meshes typically are measured by tensile testing at the macro-scale without precisely addressing the spatial scale of living cells and their submicron architecture. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) enables the examination of the nano- and micro-mechanical properties of the fibers with potential to correlate the structural mechanical properties across length scales with composition and functional behavior. In this study, a polyesteretherurethane (PEEU) polymer containing poly(p-dioxanone) (PPDO) and poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) segments was electrospun into fiber meshes or suspended single fibers. We employed AFM three point bending testing and AFM force mapping to measure the elastic modulus and stiffness of individual micro/nanofibers and the fiber mesh. The local stiffness of the fiber mesh including the randomized, intersecting structure was also examined for each individual fiber. Force mapping results with a set point of 50 nN demonstrated the dependence of the elasticity of a single fiber on the fiber mesh architecture. The non-homogeneous stiffness along the same fiber was attributed to the intersecting structure of the supporting mesh morphology. The same fiber measured at a point with and without axial fiber support showed a remarkable difference in stiffness, ranging from 0.2 to 10 nN/nm respectively. For the region, where supporting fibers densely intersected, the stiffness was found to be considerably higher. In the region where the degrees of freedom of the fibers was not restricted, allowing greater displacement, the stiffness were observed to be lower. This study elucidates the relationship between architecture and the mechanical properties of a micro/nanofiber mesh. By providing a greater understanding of the role of spatial arrangement and organization on the surface mechanical properties of such materials, we hope to provide insight into the design of microenvironments capable of regulating cell functionality."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: Frequently focal splenic lesions (FSL) - cysts, hemangioma, hamartoma, metastases or infarction amongst others – are incidentally found within the scope of the sonographic examination of the abdomen. By using native B-mode and Color Doppler the underlying entity often is not elucidated. Thus, more elaborate imaging modalities like CT and MRI scans with their associated risks are used to clarify the entity of FSL.   PURPOSE: The aim of the present retrospective single-center study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CEUS examination for assessing splenic focal lesions by comparison with findings from CT and MRI scans.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2010–2018 46 patients were included in the study. All patients underwent native B-mode, Color Doppler and CEUS after given informed consent. The applied contrast agent was a second-generation blood pool agent (SonoVue®, Bracco, Milan, Italy). CEUS examinations were performed and interpreted by a single experienced radiologist (EFSUMB Level 3).   RESULTS: All patients were examined without occurrence of any side effects. In total, 53 FSL were investigated (9% traumatic vs. 91% non-traumatic). Compared to CT, CEUS showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of 100% for assessing infarction, hematoma, hamartoma, cystic and malignant lesions. In comparison with MRI, CEUS presented a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of 100% for evaluating pseudolesions, hemangioma, hamartoma, cystic and malignant lesions.   CONCLUSION: With an excellent safety profile CEUS shows an equipollent diagnostic performance for differentiating FSL compared to CT and MRI scans."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: In most clinical studies older people are underrepresented compared to the demographic reality. However, risk for some severe diseases like cancer typically increase with age. Most insight into cancer treatment comes from mixed-age patient cohorts, leading to a lack of detailed understanding of cancer drug effects in the elderly population. There is growing evidence that cancer drug effects can be influenced by dehydration conditions often found in older people. Colon cancer remains the second leading cause of death by cancer in Europe. Inter- and intra-heterogeneity of tumors contribute to why some individuals do not respond to specific cancer therapies or may often suffer a relapse.   OBJECTIVE: Our study applies an in vitro drug test system for simulating treatment with cytostatics of colorectal cancer in elderly patients with dehydration condition.   METHODS: Two well-known colon cancer cell lines, Caco-2 and RKO, harboring defined cancer-related mutations, were step-wisely adapted from routine culture medium to a severe hyperosmotic condition (397 mOmol/kg) by adding sodium chloride to the medium. We investigated the effects of these cell culture conditions, which should mimic cellular dehydration in elderly people, on the growth characteristics of the cells. Therefore, cell proliferation was investigated by measuring population doubling times. Furthermore, we investigated how the metabolic activity of the cells was influenced by treatment with different concentrations of cyclophosphamide (CPA) under normal and hyperosmotic conditions.   RESULTS: We found that Caco-2 and RKO cell lines have an identical cell doubling time of 23 hours in normosmotic medium. However, hyperosmotic medium lifted the doubling time of Caco-2 cells to 31 hours while that of RKO cells did not change. Despite reduced cell proliferation rates, hyperosmotic medium sensitized Caco-2 cells to treatment with 10 mM CPA for 48 hours as measured by metabolic activity assays on ATP levels.   CONCLUSIONS: The two investigated colon cancer cells lines reacted differently to hyperosmotic conditions. Only the growth of Caco-2 cells was reduced by increased osmolality. Despite this reduced growth their sensitivity to an alkylating cytostatic agent was even slightly increased. We are now in line to examine these effects in more detail and with more tumor cell lines."@en ;

Side effects of the active substance include cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Doxorubicin-treated renal epithelial cells and (sarcoma) tumors are examined by correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to investigate the subcellular localization of doxorubicin.   METHODS: The kidney epithelial cell line MDCK II (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) grown on culture dishes were treated with doxorubicin. Subsequently, the cells are analyzed by means of fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In vivo, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RH 30) tumor cells are transferred to the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the chicken embryo. Doxorubicin is injected into a vein of the chicken embryo. After 24 hours, the tumor is removed and examined using CLEM.   RESULTS: The kidney epithelial cells and the doxorubicin-injected tumors show a clear staining of the cell nucleus, which correlates with electron-dense regions (heterochromatin). High-resolution TEM shows that doxorubicin treatment leads to an enormous stress situation with an increased formation of membrane blebbings.   CONCLUSIONS: CLEM is a promising new method to visualize the pattern of fluorescing drugs (e.g. doxorubicin) in renal epithelial cells and tumors, and to localize the drug in its subcellular context combined with high resolution."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: To overcome the compromised wound healing in radiation induced chronic wounds platelet-rich plasma (PRP), as therapeutic agent, is current subject of studies. PRP is associated with pro-angiogenic effects. Nevertheless, effects of platelet-rich plasma in cutaneous wound healing processes are poorly understood so far.   Methods: In this study, the migration of endothelial cells, fibroblasts and keratinocytes in conjunction with platelet-rich plasma treatment is investigated in the context of radiation effects. Additionally, cell proliferation and viability after external radiation was analyzed regarding treatment by platelet-rich plasma.   RESULTS: All cell cultures showed a trend towards decreasing proliferation and viability after irradiation irrespective of PRP. Upon PRP treatment, irradiated fibroblasts as well as endothelial cells showed an enhanced proliferation whereas proliferation and viability of keratinocytes was reduced after PRP treatment. Scratch assays support the positive effect of PRP on fibroblast and endothelial cell migration, whereas a negative effect on keratinocytes was observed after PRP treatment.   CONCLUSIONS: The present study documents both deleterious effects of external radiation as well as the protective effect of PRP. In summary, increased viability, proliferation and migration are indeed a consequence of the pro-proliferative effect exerted by PRP. Therefore, treatment with PRP products might be useful in the management of chronic radiogenic wounds."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "OBJECTIVE: The use of a standardized dynamic contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) protocol to determine perfusion of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) using quantitative analysis.   METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 27 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma examined by a standardized protocol (bolus injection of 2.4 ml sulphur hexafluoride microbubbles, arterial phase to portal venous phase using continuous CINE-loops over 1 minute, short CINE-loops after 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes and additional single images for B-mode, CCDS). The examination was performed by an experienced sonographer with a high resolution, multi-frequency transducer (1–6 MHz). The reading of the reference imaging (contrast enhanced CT and MRI) and histopathology, if necessary, was performed independently. Retrospective analysis of the CEUS DICOM loops was done using time intensity curve analysis (TIC) with evaluation of the time to peak (TTP) and the area under the curve (AUC).   RESULTS: All tumor lesions were characterized by CEUS, based on typical contrast patterns for HCC lesions with arterial enhancement and wash out in the late phase, corresponding to MRI with liver specific contrast agent or contrast enhanced CT. Mean TTP (SD) in the tumor centre (C) was 19.93 (11.31), in the periphery (P) 22.94 (9.44) and in the normal liver tissue (LT) 28.19 (11.34) with significant differences between all zones C/P (p = 0.013), C/LT (p = 0.005) and P/LT (p = 0.022). AUC mean (SD) in the tumor centre (C) was 660.03 (292.64), in the periphery (P) 586.04 (237.01) and in the normal liver tissue (LT) 484.20 (236.99), also with significant differences between all zones C/P (p = 0.001), C/LT (p < 0.001) and P/LT (p < 0.001).

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: Human hepatocyte in vitro cell culture systems are important models for drug development and toxicology studies in the context of liver xenobiotic metabolism. Often, such culture systems are used to elucidate the biotransformation of xenobiotics or drugs and further investigate drug and drug metabolite effects on biological systems in terms of potential therapeutic benefit or toxicity. Human hepatocytes currently used for such in vitro studies are mostly primary cells or cell lines derived from liver cancers. Both approaches have limitations such as low proliferation capacity and progressive dedifferentiation found in primary cells or lack of liver functions in cell lines, which makes it difficult to reliably predict biotransformation of xenobiotics in patients. In order to overcome these limitations, HepaFH3 cells and Upcyte® hepatocytes representing primary-like hepatocytes of the first and second generation are increasingly used. Based on primary human hepatocyte cells transduced for stable expression of Upcyte® proliferation genes, they are mitotically active and exhibit liver functions over an extended period, making them comparable to primary human hepatocytes. These hepatocyte models show active liver metabolism such as urea and glycogen formation as well as biotransformation of xenobiotics. The latter is based on the expression, activity and inducibility of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP) as essential phase I reaction components. However, for further characterisation in terms of performance and existing limitations, additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in phase I reactions. One prerequisite is sufficient activity of microsomal NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (POR) functionally connected as electron donor to those CYP enzymes.   OBJECTIVE: For Upcyte® hepatocytes and HepaFH3 cells, it is so far unknown to what extent POR is expressed, active, and may exert CYP-modulating effects. Here we studied POR expression and corresponding enzyme activity in human hepatoblastoma cell line HepG2 and compared this with HepaFH3 and Upcyte® hepatocytes representing proliferating primary-like hepatocytes.   METHODS: POR expression of those hepatocyte models was determined at mRNA and protein level using qRT-PCR, Western Blot and immunofluorescence staining. Kinetic studies on POR activity in isolated microsomes were performed by a colorimetric method.   RESULTS: The investigated hepatocyte models showed remarkable differences at the level of POR expression. Compared to primary-like hepatocytes, POR expression of HepG2 cells was 4-fold higher at mRNA and 2-fold higher at protein level. However, this higher expression did not correlate with corresponding enzyme activity levels in isolated microsomes, which were comparable between all cell systems tested. A tendency of higher POR activity in HepG2 cells compared to HepaFH3 (p = 0.0829) might be present. Compared to primary human hepatocyte microsomes, POR activity was considerably lower in all hepatocyte models.   CONCLUSION: In summary, our study revealed that POR expression and activity were clearly detectable in all in vitro hepatocyte models with the highest POR expression in cancer cell line HepG2. However, POR activity was lower in tested hepatocyte models when compared to human primary hepatocyte microsomes. Whether this was caused by e.g. polymorphisms or metabolic differences of investigated hepatocyte models will be target for future studies."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND:  Currently, Ethiopia is undergoing an epidemiological transition. Consequently, NCDs are becoming an increasingly important public health problem in the country. Furthermore, the country has faced a high level of food insecurity.   METHODS:  We conducted a comprehensive review based on published articles from 2010 to 2018 and WHO reports on food insecurity, malnutrition and their impacts on the burden of NCDs death in order to obtain a deeper understanding of the seriousness of the NCDs cause of deaths in relation to food insecurity and malnutrition. In addition, policy for protecting vulnerability and the implementation of SDGs on food insecurity, malnutrition, and NCDs were also discussed. The results of this review highlight the progress that was made in the overall condition of food insecurity, nutrition, and diseases in the country.   RESULTS:  The finding shows that there has been large burden of recurrent food insecurity, which could be due to malnutrition that might be associated to inconsistent rainfall distribution and also the experience of violent conflict in recent periods. However, the prevalence of undernourishment was declined from 75% in 1990s to 32% in 2015 though the numbers indicate a marginal reduction. But unexpectedly still the child mortality rate of under-five that results from malnutrition accounts about 57% of all children deaths. As the result of malnutrition, obesity is recognized as the determinants for a number of NCDs such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Communicable diseases seems the only identified health problem in the country, however; the burden of NCDs is facing major aspects. Hence, NCDs like cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, currently, are among the leading causes of death among adults, which is responsible for 39% of deaths in the country in 2015 while the risk of premature NCDs mortality was reached about 15.2%. Of these deaths, 4% was due to cancer and 9% was related to other NCDs such as obesity and nutrition-related cases. Therefore, food insecurity has a high-flying impact in early death from chronic health conditions and the cause of undernutrition that leads to an augmented susceptibility and decreased flexibility to NCDs as a result of compromised nutrition.   CONCLUSION:  In order to sustain the economic growth, reduce poverty and achieving food security, the Ethiopian government has started discourse at high level of agenda hoping to avoid recurrent violent conflict, food insecurity and famine by targeting urban low-income households and empowering youth and women."@en ;

These transcripts regulate expression of numerous genes at different levels by acting as decoys, scaffolds, and enhancers. Thus they regulate cell development, differentiation and fate.   OBJECTIVE:  To find the role of lncRNAs in various diseases.   METHODS:  We searched PubMed and google scholar and summarized the data regarding the role of lncRNAs in cancer and neurologic disorders.   RESULTS:  Several recent studies have shown that their expressions are up-/down-regulated in malignant tissues. Consequently, they have suggested that lncRNAs can differentiate cancer samples from normal samples. Their application as biomarker is not limited to cancers. In several neurologic or psychiatric disorders researchers have found aberrant expression of lncRNAs.   CONCLUSIONS:  Taken together, lncRNAs constitute a novel vast area of research to find answer to fundamental biologic questions."@en ;

A previous high throughput study of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) expression in lung cancer has identified aberrant expression of SGO1-antisense 1 (SGO1-AS1) in these specimens. In the current study, we quantified expression of SGO1 and SGO1-AS1 in 39 breast cancer tissues and their paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs). Expression of SGO1-AS1 was considerably decreased in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs (expression ratio = 0.49, P value = 0.03). However, we could not identify significant difference in expression of SGO1 between these two sets of specimens (expression ratio = 2.9, P value = 0.2). Transcript quantities of SGO1-AS1 were associated with age at disease onset (P= 0.01). Expression of either gene was associated with hormone receptors status or clinical features such as grade and stage. There was an inverse correlation between expressions of genes in both sets of samples. Finally, transcript amounts of SGO1-AS1 could distinguish these two sets of samples with accuracy of 63% (P value = 0.03). Our results imply significance of SGO1-AS1 in breast cancer and necessitate conduction of mechanistic studies to find the molecular pathways in this regard."@en ;

The aim of study was to present the point of views, prospect and priorities of Emergency medical services case teams and its coordinator along some main dimensions of emergency medical services, such as Leadership, Motivation, Structure, and Assurance for implementation.   METHODS:  Six focus group discussion were facilitated with EMS case teams, focal persons and FMoH emergency medical services case teams from December to August, 2017 in all regions chosen of the study. The focus group techniques were used in the study as qualitative research method for examination of viewpoints of case team members towards to the emergency medical care system and overall pre-hospital and at hospital emergency care services. The discussion was addressing the topics of: general aspects of emergency Medical Services (EMS) and which occupations included in EMS; possibilities to importance review EMS issues based on Leadership, Motivation, Structure, and Assurance for implementation of EMS in the country. Finally, thematic analysis was used to evaluate data sets which collected during the focus group discussion.   RESULTS:  There were 6 focus groups in total: an Emergency medical services case teams, officers, Directorates, and integrated disease prevention and control program coordinators groups in each of the regional, city Administration Health Bureau and Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia. Findings of the thematic analysis were summarized along the following dimensions: Leadership, Motivation, Structure, and Assurance for implementation. The result shown that lack of resources, shortage of training, lack of professionals and community awareness on EMS, immaturity of EMS strategic plan and lack of revision, workload as a result of limited skilled manpower, lack of partnerships and collaboration on EMS and lack of research and community services evidence are among factors affecting the quality EMS and continuity of the program at various health care facilities at the regional and national levels.   CONCLUSION:  The study shows views of the Ethiopian Emergency Medical Services Case teams’ and officers in Emergency Medical services in Ethiopia.

(2) We seek the shortest weights between every pair of nodes in a given interval-valued fuzzy network based on a dynamic approach. (3) In contrast to most existing approaches, which provide the shortest path between two predetermined nodes, the proposed approach provides the interval-valued fuzzy shortest path between every pair of nodes. (4) Similarly to the competing methods in the literature, the proposed approach not only gives the interval-valued fuzzy weights of all pairs shortest path but also provides the corresponding interval-valued fuzzy APSP.

Prior studies have identified declining dementia incidence associated with changes in cardiovascular risk factors and increased educational attainment. However, few studies have examined these factors in multi-ethnic cohorts.   Objective: To identify secular trends in the incidence rate of dementia in an elderly population.   Methods: Participants in this study were drawn from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project, a multi-ethnic cohort study of northern Manhattan residents aged 65 years and older. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine differences in the incidence of dementia in cohorts recruited in 1992 and 1999, with age at dementia or age at last follow-up visit as the “time-to-event” variable.   Results: Overall, there was a 41% reduction in the hazard ratio for dementia among participants in the 1999 cohort compared with those in the 1992 cohort, adjusting for age, sex, race, and baseline memory complaints (HR = 0.59). The reduction in incidence was greatest among non-Hispanic Whites and African-Americans and lowest among Hispanic participants (HRs = 0.60, 0.52 and 0.64, respectively), and was associated with increases in level of educational attainment, especially among African-Americans. Reduction in incidence of dementia was also greater among persons 75 years or older than among younger participants (HR = 0.52 versus HR = 0.69).

Previous research argues that higher education helps to preserve cognition in older adults with AD pathology because of its key role in cognitive reserve and resilience.   Objective: To test if higher educational level buffers the effect of APOE ɛ4 on cognition among older non-Hispanic Blacks.   Methods: Participants were 849 non-demented older non-Hispanic Blacks (38.3% APOE ɛ4+), who underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. Multiple linear regression models tested the relationship between APOE ɛ4 status and twelve cognitive measures with education (up to high school and beyond high school) as a moderator.   Results: Education buffered the effects of the APOE ɛ4 allele, such that there was no impact of APOE ɛ4 status on word-list memory retention and working memory among participants with more than a high school degree. This pattern was not observed for ten other cognitive measures of verbal and visual episodic memory, semantic memory, executive function, and processing speed—although a similar trend was observed for switching ability in executive functioning. The buffering effect of education was stronger among women than men.   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that genetic effects on late-life cognition may be modified by environmental factors such as educational attainment. These results are consistent with the framework of cognitive reserve such that engaging in cognitively enriching activities and acquiring skills and knowledge with more years of education may increase the capacity to maintain cognitive function despite high genetic risk for impairment."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) refers to the self-perception of cognitive decline among cognitively normal elderly individuals. SCD related worry confers a higher risk of developing cognitive decline. However, the clinical characteristics of SCD patients with worry are not clear.   Objective: To explore the clinical characteristics of SCD patients with worry.   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out, with 270 consecutive participants of the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline (SILCODE) study. Participants were classified as normal controls (n = 36), SCD patients without worry (n = 91), or SCD patients with worry (n = 143) and were comprehensively compared on 1) their self-perception of cognitive decline, 2) multiple cognitive domains, 3) neuropsychiatric symptoms, and 4) sleep status.   Results: SCD patients with worry had significantly more self-perception of cognitive decline (p < 0.001); increased depression (p < 0.001) and anxiety (p < 0.001); decreased sleep quality (p < 0.001), sleep latency (p < 0.05), sleep time (p < 0.01), and sleep efficiency (p < 0.05); more sleep disorders (p < 0.05) and daytime dysfunction (p < 0.05); and a higher global score on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (p < 0.001) than normal controls. Although there was a significant increase only in self-perception of cognitive decline (p < 0.001), anxiety (p < 0.001), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (p < 0.05), the severity of the increase in those without worry was between that in SCD patients with worry and normal controls.   Conclusion: Our findings show that participants who had SCD with worry showed distinct clinical characteristics compared with normal controls and SCD patients without worry, which could be useful for understanding the higher risk in SCD patients with worry of subsequently developing Alzheimer’s disease."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Detecting subtle changes in visual attention from electroencephalography (EEG) and the perspective of eye movement in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients can be of great significance in screening early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in a large population at primary care.   Objective: We proposed an automatic, non-invasive, and quick MCI detection approach based on multimodal physiological signals for clinical decision-marking.   Methods: The proposed model recruited 152 patients with MCI and 184 healthy elderly controls (HC) who underwent EEG and eye movement signal recording under a visual stimuli task, as well as other neuropsychological assessments. Forty features were extracted from EEG and eye movement signals by linear and nonlinear analysis. The features related to MCI were selected by logistic regression analysis. To evaluate the efficacy of this MCI detection approach, we applied the same procedures to achieve the Clinical model, EEG model, Eye movement model, EEG+ Clinical model, Eye movement+ Clinical model, and Combined model, and compared the classification accuracy between the MCI and HC groups with the above six models.   Results: After the penalization of logistic regression analysis, five features from EEG and eye movement features exhibited significant differences (p < 0.05). In the classification experiment, the combined model resulted in the best accuracy. The average accuracy for the Clinical/EEG/Eye movement/EEG+ Clinical/Eye movement+ Clinical/Combined model was 68.69%, 61.79%, 73.13%, 69.46%, 75.61%, and 81.51%, respectively.   Conclusion: These results suggest that the proposed MCI detection tool has the potential to screen MCI patients from HCs and may be a powerful tool for personalized precision MCI screening in the large-scale population under primary care condition."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are a heterogeneous group of secreted particles consisting of microvesicles, which are released by budding of the cellular membrane, and exosomes, which are secreted through exocytosis from multivesicular bodies. EV cargo consists of a wide range of proteins and nucleic acids that can be transferred between cells. Importantly, EVs may be pathogenically involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While EVs derived from AD neurons have been found to be neurotoxic in vitro, little is known about the pathological consequences of AD EVs in vivo. Furthermore, although all known familial AD (fAD) mutations involve either amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) or the machinery that processes AβPP, hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau appears to play a critical role in fAD-associated neurodegeneration, and previous reports suggest EVs may propagate tau pathology in the AD brain. Therefore, we hypothesized that fAD EVs may have a mechanistic involvement in the development of fAD-associated tau pathology. To test this, we isolated EVs from iPSC-derived neuronal cultures generated from an fAD patient harboring a A246E mutation to presenilin-1 and stereotactically injected these EVs into the hippocampi of wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Five weeks after injection, mice were euthanized and pathology evaluated. Mice injected with fAD EVs displayed increased tau phosphorylation at multiple sites relative to PBS and non-disease control EV injected groups. Moreover, fAD EV injected hippocampi contained significantly more tau inclusions in the CA1 hippocampal neuronal field than controls. In total, these findings identify EVs as a potential mediator of fAD-associated tau dysregulation and warrant future studies to investigate the therapeutic potential of EV-targeted treatments for fAD."@en ;

The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of RAS are altered in AD in relation to established CSF markers of disease pathology (lower Aβ42 and elevated tau) and CSF markers of capillary dysfunction. We studied 40 controls and 40 AD cases grouped according to a biomarker profile (i.e., AD cases t-tau>400 pg/mL, pTau >60 pg/mL, and Aβ42 <550 pg/mL). Angiotensin-II converting enyme-1 (ACE1) and ACE2 enzyme activity was measured using fluorogenic peptide substrates; sPDGFRβ and albumin level by sandwich ELISA; and angiotensin-I (Ang-I), Ang-II, and Ang-(1-7) by direct ELISA. CSF Aβ42, total, and phosphorylated tau levels were previously measured by INNOTEST sandwich ELISA. CSF ACE1 activity was significantly elevated in AD (p = 0.008) and positively correlated with ACE2 in AD (r = 0.420, p = 0.007). CSF ACE1 weakly correlated with t-tau (r = 0.294, p = 0.066) and p-tau (r = 0.329, p = 0.038) but not with Aβ42 in the controls but not in AD. ACE1 correlated positively with sPDGFRβ (r = 0.426, p = 0.007), a marker of pericyte injury, and ACE2 correlated positively with albumin (r = 0.422, p = 0.008), a marker of blood-brain barrier integrity. CSF Ang-I, Ang-II, and Ang-(1-7) levels were unchanged in AD. This cross-sectional CSF study indicates RAS dysfunction in relation to capillary damage in AD."@en ;

Previous studies suggest that ghrelin and its receptor, growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1α (GHSR1α), promote hippocampal synaptic function and neurogenesis. GHSR1α activation thus holds the potential to be a therapeutic avenue for the treatment of hippocampal pathology in AD; however, a comprehensive study on the preventive effect of MK0677 on hippocampal lesions in AD-related conditions is still lacking. In this study, we treated a transgenic mouse model of AD-like amyloidosis (5xFAD mice) at the asymptomatic stage with MK0677, a potent ghrelin mimetic. We found that MK0677 fostered hippocampal neurogenesis in 5xFAD mice but observed little preventive function with regards to the development of hippocampal amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, synaptic loss, microglial activation, or cognitive impairment. Furthermore, MK0677 at a dose of 3 mg/kg significantly increased 5xFAD mouse mortality. Despite enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis, MK0677 treatment has little beneficial effect to prevent hippocampal lesions or cognitive deficits against Aβ toxicity. This study, together with a failed large-scale clinical trial, suggests the ineffectiveness of MK0677 alone for AD prevention and treatment."@en ;

Objective: This study examined the effects of inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of prefrontal cortex on recognition memory in AD patients.   Methods: In a first experiment, 24 mild AD patients received sham and real 1Hz rTMS over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), in different sessions, between encoding and retrieval phases of a non-verbal recognition memory task. In a second experiment, another group of 14 AD patients underwent sham controlled repeated sessions of 1Hz rTMS of the right DLPFC across a two week treatment. Non-verbal recognition memory task was performed at baseline, at the end of the two weeks period and at a follow up of 1 month.   Results: Right real rTMS significantly improved memory performance compared to right sham rTMS (p = 0.001). Left real rTMS left the memory performance unchanged as compared with left sham rTMS (p = 0.46). The two sham conditions did not differ between each other (p = 0.24). In the second experiment, AD patients treated with real rTMS showed an improvement of memory performance at the end of the two weeks treatment (p = 0.0009), that persisted at 1-month follow-up (p = 0.002).   Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that inhibitory rTMS over the right DLPFC can improve recognition memory function in AD patients. They also suggest the importance of a new approach of non-invasive brain stimulation as a promising treatment in AD."@en ;

Methods: Eighty older people with mild dementia were recruited and randomly assigned to a Tai Chi group or a control group. The Tai Chi group practiced the Tai Chi program three times a week for 10 months, while the control group continued receiving routine treatments. All participants were assessed for cognitive function, behavior/mood, and activities of daily living at baseline, 5 months, and 10 months.   Results: The Tai Chi group performed better than the control group. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant group×time interaction in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Further analysis of sub-items of the MoCA showed a significant time effect in naming and abstraction. It was statistically significant in both main effect of time and group×time interaction in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Paired sample t test showed the Tai Chi group scored lower at 5 and 10 months in the NPI and at 10 months in the GDS compared with baseline. The Tai Chi group scored lower than the control group at 10 months in the NPI and GDS.

A pathological hallmark of AD is accumulation and deposition of amyloid-β protein (Aβ), a ∼4 kDa peptide generated through serial cleavage of the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) by β- and γ-secretases. Curcumin is a natural compound primarily found in the widely used culinary spice, turmeric, which displays therapeutic potential for AD. Recently, we reported the development of curcumin analogs and identified a lead compound, curcumin-like compound-R17 (CLC-R17), that significantly attenuates Aβ deposition in an AD transgenic mouse model. Here, we elucidated the mechanisms of this analog on Aβ levels and AβPP processing using cell models of AD. Using biochemical methods and our recently developed nanoplasmonic fiber tip probe technology, we showed that the lead compound potently lowers Aβ levels in conditioned media and reduces oligomeric amyloid levels in the cells. Furthermore, like curcumin, the lead compound attenuates the maturation of AβPP in the secretory pathway. Interestingly, it upregulated α-secretase processing of AβPP and inhibited β-secretase processing of AβPP by decreasing BACE1 protein levels. Collectively, our data reveal mechanisms of a promising curcumin analog in reducing Aβ levels, which strongly support its development as a potential therapeutic for AD."@en ;

Risk reduction messages should include key recommendations for women in response to the high prevalence of dementia observed in this population. Midlife is a critical period for dementia-related brain changes and psychosocial crises. Psychological well-being can improve resilience to crises, yet it is not well understood with respect to dementia risk reduction.   Objective: This study aimed to examine the association between midlife psychological well-being and cognitive function in later life in women.   Methods: The study included 703 women from the British 1946 birth cohort in the Medical Research Council’s National Survey of Health and Development. Psychological well-being at 52 years was assessed using the Ryff Scales of Psychological Well-being over six dimensions: autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive relations with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. Cognitive function at 69 years was measured using the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination, Third Edition.   Results: After controlling for cognitive ability at eight years, educational attainment by 26 years, occupational attainment and marital status by 53 years, depression, smoking, and physical exercise at 60–64 years, there was a significant association between greater personal growth and lower self-acceptance at 52 years, and better cognition at 69 years. However, there was no association between cognition and the other four Ryff scales.   Conclusion: Most aspects of midlife psychological well-being, except for personal growth and self-acceptance, were not prospectively associated with cognition."@en ;

Objective: We aimed to examine changes in the age-specific prevalence of cognitive impairment in the Czech Republic.   Methods: The study used two samples from the population-based Czech Survey on Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Age-specific prevalence of cognitive impairment (defined based on scores in verbal fluency, immediate recall, delayed recall, and temporal orientation) was compared between participants in wave 2 (2006/2007; n = 1,107) and wave 6 (2015; n = 3,104). Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between the wave and cognitive impairment, step-wise adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Multiple sensitivity analyses, focusing on alternative operationalizations of relative cognitive impairment, impact of missing cognitive data, and survival bias, were carried out.   Results: The most conservative estimate suggested that the age-specific prevalence of cognitive impairment declined by one fifth, from 11% in 2006/2007 to 9% in 2015. Decline was observed in all sensitivity analyses. The change was associated with differences in physical inactivity, management of high blood cholesterol, and increases in length education.   Conclusion: Older adults in the Czech Republic, a country situated in the Central and Eastern European region, have achieved positive developments in cognitive aging. Longer education, better management of cardiovascular factors, and reduced physical inactivity seem to be of key importance."@en ;

We tested this assumption by evaluating 30 consecutive forensic examinations in which neuropathology consultation was sought, and in which a history of remote TBI was uncovered during the course of the investigation. In this series, there was a high frequency of psychiatric co-morbidities (100%), remote contusion (90%), and seizures (63%). Extent of proteinopathy showed no differences with age-matched controls. A subset of the cases showed focal geographic tauopathy that correlated with older age at autopsy, but had no correlation with clinical signs, and was minimal in comparison with the encephalomalacia secondary to trauma. The results suggest that cerebral contusion and post-traumatic epilepsy may be over-represented in civilian TBI, while structural brain damage from trauma is the predominant cause of morbidity following TBI. We found no evidence that TBI initiates a progressive proteinopathy."@en ;

Compared to CH aging, SIVCI was characterized by a profile of significantly slowed RT, raised IIV, and higher error levels, particularly in the presence of distracting stimuli, indicating that the integrity and/or accessibility of the additional functions required to support high processing load, serial search strategies, are reduced in SIVCI. Furthermore, although practice speeded RT in SIVCI, unlike CH, practice did not lead to an improvement in IIV. This indicates that improvement in RT in SIVCI can in fact mask an abnormally high degree of IIV. Because IIV appears more related to disease, function, and health than RT, its status and potential for change may represent a particularly meaningful, and relevant, disease characteristic of SIVCI. Finally, a high level of within-group variation in the above measures was another characteristic of SIVCI, with such processing heterogeneity in patients with ostensibly the same diagnosis, possibly related to individual variation in pathological load. Detailed measurement of RT, IIV, errors, and practice effects therefore reveal a degree of functional impairment in brain processing not apparent by measuring RT in isolation."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND:  To detect most of bloodborne pathogens, serum must be separated from whole blood for efficient nucleic acid amplification. Centrifugation is the most commonly used preparation step for whole blood, but it is not easy to use a centrifuge in rural areas where electricity is not accessible.   OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to develop a simple method for obtaining serum suitable for nucleic acid amplification without the use of any instruments.   METHODS:  Whole blood spiked with Escherichia coli (E. coli) was separated into serum and cellular fraction using 2 closely attached membranes with different characteristics. After brief heating, bacterial DNA in the serum was used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR).   RESULTS:  Serum was successfully separated from cellular fraction after filtration of one membrane sheet. Membrane sheet containing serum was heated and bacterial DNA in the serum was used for PCR. The quality and concentration of DNA in the heated serum was sufficient for PCR and amplified E. coli gene products were observed.   CONCLUSIONS:  Separation of bacteria-containing serum was feasible using two membrane sheets and the DNA isolated from serum can be used for PCR after brief heating."@en ;

OBJECTIVE: To develop a model that explains how employer and rehabilitation professional mental health literacy may influence strategies used in the return-to-work of persons with mental health problems.   METHODS: A grounded theory study design was used to collect and analyse interview data from 23 employers and 22 rehabilitation professionals.   RESULTS: The analysis resulted in four categories, illustrated in a conceptual process model: 1) seeing mental health problems through past experiences; 2) separating understandable and incomprehensible mental health problems; 3) balancing safeguarding one’s personal interest with providing adequate support; and 4) facing conflicts and uncertainty in employee/service user return-to-work. A positional map of employer/rehabilitation types was created based on level of negative attitudes and uncertainty in supporting employees/service users and the employer in relation to the level of comprehensive understanding of mental health problems.   CONCLUSIONS: Professional mental health literacy needs to be increased. Interventions need to be developed that provide employers with targeted support and knowledge in mental health literacy. Education on how to prevent and detect common mental health problems in the workplace is needed."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: Overall, health-related correlates of job demands and job resources are well-known. However, in today’s working life, personal resources are considered to be of increasing importance. Beyond general mental ability, knowledge regarding personal resources remains limited. This is particularly so among women working in the welfare sector, a sector mainly employing women and with the work typically involving clients.   OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the importance of job demands, job resources, and personal resources for health-related outcomes, as well as the mitigating effects of resources, among women working within the Swedish welfare sector.   METHODS: Self-reports from 372 women employed within the welfare sector were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression.   RESULTS: Overall, increasing job demands were associated with poorer health outcomes while increasing job resources and personal resources were associated with better health. Additionally, lower control aggravated the effects of quantitative job demands on health outcomes while lower feedback mitigated the effect of qualitative demands. However, personal resources had no moderating effect.   CONCLUSIONS: Job resources seem more pertinent to health than personal resources, at least among women working within the welfare sector in Sweden."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "INTRODUCTION: Focal therapy (FT) of the prostate for low risk prostate cancer (PCa) is an alternative to traditional definite treatment options like external beam radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy. However, follow up after FT is still challenging and is subject to current studies. Significance of imaging after FT such as multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is currently not well established. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of alternative imaging during the follow up of low risk PCa treated with focal HIFU therapy using CEUS and image fusion.   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective single arm study in patients with uni- or bilateral, low or intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with HIFU at our institution between October 2016 and January 2018. CEUS in combination with image fusion using an axial T2-weighted MRI sequence was performed during follow up 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the therapy.   RESULTS: 4 consecutive patients with Gleason score (GS) 6 and 4 patients with GS 7a prostate cancer were included in the study. Hemiablation was performed in 7 patients with unilateral tumor. One patient underwent whole gland treatment due to histological proven bilateral PCa. Mean patient age at time of therapy was 70.3 (54–83) years and mean Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level prior treatment was 7.8 ng/ml (2.1–14.4), after 3 months mean PSA level was 3.9 ng/ml (0.1–7.2), after 6 months 3.5 ng/ml (0.2–6.0), after 9 months 3.1 ng/ml (0.2–6.8) and 3.3 ng/ml (0.2–6.1) after 12 months. CEUS showed no signs of microvascularisation after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in the ablated zone. 3 months posttreatment the necrotic tissue was still visible in the B-mode scan, although with no signs of vascularization performing CEUS. After 6 months the ablated side of the prostate was almost completely atrophic. And after 9 months the necrotic tissue was completely resolved. Between 9 and 12 months no changes in microvascularisation and perfusion could be shown.   CONCLUSIONS: MpMRI/CEUS image fusion is a cost-effective and feasible technique to monitor the perfusion of the ablation zone after focal therapy of the prostate."@en ;

OBJECTIVE:  This research was conducted to determine the status of full blood count, zinc and manganese levels among Diabetic patients attending Specialist Hospital, Sokoto.   METHODS:  The participants were divided into two groups; 58 diabetic subjects and 29 non-diabetic controls. Five milliliters of blood were collected into EDTA and plain containers for full blood count, serum zinc and manganese analysis. The FBC investigation was carried out using automated Mythic Haematology analyzer (Orphee, Switzerland) while Zn and Mn investigations were carried out using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). The FBC, Zn and Mn status of both control and subjects were compared statistically.   RESULTS:  The results obtained in this study showed a significant increase in RBC, PCV, Hb, Basophils, Eosinophil, Lymphocyte count and Manganese levels of diabetic subjects (p⩽ 0.05) when compared with controls. There was no statistically significant difference in the other FBC parameters and Zinc levels between diabetic subjects and non-diabetic controls (p> 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the Hb, PCV and lymphocyte of diabetic patients based on gender (p< 0.05). FBC, Manganese and Zinc have no effect based on age group, while other socio-demographic factors also have no effect on the FBC, Manganese and Zinc parameters of diabetic patients. The study also showed no statistical difference in the FBC, Manganese and Zinc of smokers and non-smokers (p> 0.05, respectively). In conclusion, this research shows that some haematological parameters (RBC count, Basophils, Eosinophil, Lymphocyte, Hb and Manganese) of the diabetic patients are significantly higher compared to non-diabetic controls. Marital status had a significant effect on the Hb, PCV and Lymphocyte of the diabetic patients (p< 0.05). The age group had no significant effect on the Hb, PCV and Lymphocyte of diabetic subjects (p> 0.05).   CONCLUSIONS  There is need to routinely monitor the full blood count, zinc and manganese levels among diabetic subjects in the area to optimize the care offered to these patients."@en ;

We aimed to identify and describe the prevalence, patterns, magnitude and associated factors of trauma in the Emergency Department at Health Institute in Ethiopia.   METHODS:  In this systematic review, we searched for peer-reviewed and grey literature publications reporting the prevalence, pattern, magnitude and associated factors of trauma between 2000 and 2019. The documents which recruited are directly related to trauma and emergency department. In this regard, we searched databases of PubMed, Elsevier, Science directed, MEDLINE, and Google scholar by using Google as searching engine. Furthermore, publication with secondary data and not in English was excluded.   FINDINGS:  A total of 9,768 injured participants were included in the studies, of which 71.2% (6950) were males. Among the injured participants, 53.4% of cases were living in Addis Ababa followed by Gondar and Jimma with 20.3% and 11.3% cases, respectively. Severe road traffic accident, occupational injury, and surgical patients were among the major risk factors of trauma. The mortality rate of the trauma case fatality was reached about 4%. The majority of the studies (37.5%) analyzed the pattern and magnitude of trauma among patients seen at emergency outpatient department of health institutes in Ethiopia. The largest percentage of studies (62.5%) relied on systematic random sampling. Thirty eight percent of the reviewed studies were utilized retrospective approaches to address the research questions. An completed the registry forms and/or Kampla Trauma Score (KTS), which accounted for 37.5% of articles on prevalence, pattern, magnitude and associated factors of trauma in the emergency was the most commonly used strategy. The majority (75%) of the reviewed studies were used both descriptive statistics and bivarate and multivariate logistic regression for data analysis. The majority 6950 (71%) of the participants who have been included in those reviewed articles were male and 2818 (29%) were female by gender. Meanwhile, the majority 5 (62.5%) of reviewed studies had included < 1000 injured persons.   CONCLUSION:  The degree and types of injuries in different hospitals in Ethiopia was considerably high and its casualty is also under predictable. Therefore, a variety of actions including policy decision should be implemented in order to minimize the incidence of trauma at department of emergency care center in the country."@en ;

METHODS:  Twenty healthy men participants were randomly assigned to three conditions [0 Hz, 25 Hz, 40 Hz] prior to the study. They stood barefoot on the non-dominant leg and performed WBV of 5 sets × 30 seconds. In pre- and post-WBV in each condition, the participants measured ankle dorsiflexion angle; single leg squat jump (SLSJ) height; and dynamic postural stability index (DPSI), anterior-posterior stability index (APSI), medial-lateral stability index (MLSI), and vertical stability index (VSI).   RESULTS:  Ankle dorsiflexion angle at 25 and 40 Hz and SLSJ height at 25 Hz significantly increased after WBV (p< 0.01). DPSI and APSI at 25 Hz and 40 Hz significantly decreased, except VSI, which was significant only at 25 Hz (p< 0.05).   CONCLUSIONS:  The acute effects of exposure to WBV on flexibility, jump performance, and dynamic balance ability differ by the selected vibration frequencies."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) within senile plaques in the brain and neuroinflammation, possibly driven by the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) hamper the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly.   Objective: We utilized an in vitro model reproducing the Aβ-driven inflammation seen in AD to analyze whether stavudine (D4T), a prototypical NRTI, modulates Aβ-mediated inflammasome activation and the ability of macrophages to eliminate Aβ via phagocytosis and autophagy.   Methods: THP-1-derived macrophages were stimulated in vitro with Aβ42 or with Aβ42 after LPS-priming in the presence/absence of D4T. NLRP3 and TREM2 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR; phagocytosis, as well as ASC-Speck formation, was analyzed by Amnis FlowSight Imaging; NLRP3-produced cytokines were quantified by ELISA and, finally, autophagy was analyzed by measuring p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, beclin, p70-S6Kinase, and Lamp by ELISA and western blot.   Results: IL-1β, IL-18, and caspase-1 were increased whereas Aβ phagocytosis and TREM2 were reduced in LPS+Aβ42-stimulated cells. D4T reduced NLRP3 assembly as well as IL-18 and caspase-1 production, but did not affect IL-1β production and TREM2 expression. Notably, whereas D4T reduced Aβ phagocytosis, Aβ autophagy by macrophages was stimulated by D4T, as witnessed by the down-modulation of ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation and the upregulation of beclin, LAMP, and p70-S6K, their downstream targets.   Conclusion: In this in vitro model of AD, D4T reduces NLRP3 inflammasome-associated inflammation and stimulates Aβ autophagy by macrophages. It will be interesting to verify the possibly beneficial effects of D4T in the clinical scenario."@en ;

The identification of biomarkers for early diagnosis may thus be crucial for early intervention and identification of high-risk subjects, the most appropriate target of new drugs as soon as they will be discovered. INTERCEPTOR is a strategic project by the Italian Ministry of Health and the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA), aiming to validate the best combination (highly accurate, non-invasive, available on the whole national territory and financially sustainable) of biomarkers and organizational model for early diagnosis. 500 MCI subjects will be enrolled at baseline and followed-up for 3 years for at least 400 of them in order to define a “hub & spoke” nationwide model with recruiting (spokes) centers for MCI identification and expert (hubs) centers for risk diagnosis."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Elevated peripheral levels of different cytokines and chemokines in subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as compared with healthy controls (HC), have emphasized the role of inflammation in such a disease. Considering the cross-talking between the central nervous system and the periphery, the inflammatory analytes may provide utility as biomarkers to identify AD at earlier stages.   Objective: Using an advanced statistical approach, we can discriminate the interactive network of cytokines/chemokines and propose a useful tool to follow the progression and evolution of AD, also in light of sex differences.   Methods: A cohort of 289 old-age subjects was screened for cytokine and chemokine profiling, measured in plasma, after a thorough clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. A custom algorithm based on Fisher linear discriminant analysis was applied to ascertain a classification signature able to discriminate HC from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.   Results: We observed that a joint expression of three proteins (a “signature” composed by IFN-α2, IL-1α, TNFα) can discriminate HC from AD with an accuracy of 65.24%. Using this signature on MCI samples, 84.93% of them were classified as “non-HC”. Stratifying MCI samples by sex, we observed that 87.23% of women were classified as “non-HC”, and only 57.69% of males. Indeed, in a scatter plot of IFN-α2 and IL-1α, the HC group was better separated from MCI and AD in women as compared with men.   Conclusion: These findings suggest that AD is accompanied by a peripheral inflammatory response that can already be present in MCI subjects, thus providing a mean for detecting this at-risk status and allow an anticipated intervention."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a heterogeneous syndrome that is difficult to diagnose at early stages. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NFL) has been proposed as a potential biomarker for PPA.   Objective: To examine the diagnostic properties of plasma NFL in PPA and to evaluate its association with clinical stages of the disease and brain metabolism.   Methods: Our study included 80 participants (13 with non-fluent, 12 with semantic, and 16 with logopenic variant PPA; 13 with amnestic Alzheimer’s disease [AD]; 13 with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; and 13 healthy controls). Plasma NFL concentration was measured using a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. PET imaging was performed in a subgroup of patients.   Results: NFL discriminated patients from controls with an area under the curve of 0.914 (95% CI, 0.843–0.984; p < 0.001) (cut-off: 76.46 pg/mL; 94% sensitivity, 76.9% specificity). There were no significant differences between clinical syndromes (PPA subtypes), the main clinical forms of dementia (frontotemporal dementia and AD), or the expected pathological groups (frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau [FTLD-tau], FTLD-TDP43, and AD). NFL levels showed weak to moderate correlations with age and functional scale score. We found no significant correlation with the extent of hypometabolism observed on FDG-PET images.   Conclusion: Plasma NFL is a non-specific marker of neurodegeneration, and may be helpful in the diagnosis of PPA. However, NFL does not permit differential diagnosis between PPA subtypes and is not correlated with the extent of neurodegeneration."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: The ROBiGAME project aims to implement serious games on robots to rehabilitate upper limb (UL) motor function in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Serious game characteristics (target position, level of assistance/resistance, level of force) are typically adapted based on the child’s assessment before and continuously during the game (measuring UL working area, kinematics and muscle strength).   OBJECTIVE: This study developed an UL robotic motor assessment protocol to configure the serious game.   METHODS: Forty-nine healthy children and 20 CP children participated in the study. The clinical assessment consisted of the child’s UL length and isometric force. The robot assessment consisted of the child’s UL working area (WA), the UL isometric and isokinetic force in three directions and the UL kinematics during a pointing task toward targets placed at different distances.   RESULTS: Results showed that WA and UL isometric force were moderately to highly correlated with clinical measures. Ratios between the UL isokinetic force generated on three directions were established. The velocity and straightness indexes of all children increased when they had to reach to targets placed more distant.   CONCLUSIONS: This protocol can be integrated into different serious games in order to continuously configure the game characteristics to a child’s performance.   Trial registration: The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02543424), 12 August 2015."@en ;

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dance classes based on Dance for PD®, improve cognition, psychological symptoms and Quality of Life (QoL) in PD.   METHODS: Participants were allocated to a Dance Group (DG; n = 17) or Control Group (CG: n = 16). Participants had early-stage PD (Hoehn & Yahr: DG = 1.6±0.7, CG = 1.5±0.8) with no cognitive impairment (Addenbrooke’s score: DG = 93.2±3.6, CG = 92.6±4.3). The DG undertook a one-hour class, twice weekly for 12 weeks, while the CG had treatment as usual. Both groups were assessed for disease severity (MDS-UPDRS), cognition (NIH Toolbox® cognition battery, Trail Making Test), psychological symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, MDS-UPDRS-I) and QoL (PDQ-39, MDS-UPDRS-II).   RESULTS: Group comparison of pre-post change scores showed that selected cognitive skills (executive function and episodic memory), psychological symptoms (anxiety and depression) as well as QoL (PDQ-39 summary index) were significantly improved by the intervention (DG > CG, p’s < 0.05, Cohen’s d > 0.8).   DISCUSSIONS and CONCLUSION: Dance classes had a clear benefit on psychological symptoms, QoL and a limited cognitive benefit. Follow-up assessment is required to confirm the durability of these effects."@en ;

In the past years, studies showed that the additional use of contrast media to the conventional ultrasound allows the early depiction of pathological microvessels and their flow elucidating suspect findings stipulating the prompt therapy approach.   OBJECTIVE: The study aims to evaluate the performance of CEUS in gallbladder diseases and compare it to MR imaging using histopathological findings as a gold standard.   MATERIAL AND METHODS: The retrospective mono-center study analysed 18 patients with gallbladder alterations between 2009 and 2017. All patients underwent CEUS and MRI examinations and all results were confirmed in the pathology. CEUS images were performed and interpreted by a single experienced physician.   RESULTS: CEUS imaging results compared to MR imaging of the gallbladder demonstrated a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 67% and a negative predictive value of 100%.   CONCLUSION: CEUS enables the depiction and characterization of important vascularization’s patterns facilitating the early differentiation between malignant and benign findings. In this study, CEUS displayed a better diagnostic accuracy than MRI proving to be a valuable additional tool to the established imaging modalities."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Laminin-5 (Ln-5), an important extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, plays a critical role in regulating the growth and differentiation of mesodermal tissues, including bone. Ln-5 can be secreted by the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and Ln-5 promotes MSCs osteogenic differentiation. It has been demonstrated that a substrate’s surface topography could regulate MSC secretion and differentiation. A better understanding of the mechanism of how Ln-5 and surface roughness regulate MSC osteogenic differentiation would guide the design of surface topography and coatings of orthopedic implants and cell culture substrates. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between surface roughness and the secretion of Ln-5 in MSC osteogenic differentiation. Whether substrate surface topography regulates MSC differentiation via regulating Ln-5 secretion and how surface topography contributes to the secretion of Ln-5 are still not known. In this study, the influence of microscale roughness at different levels (R0, R1 and R2) on the secretion of Ln-5 of human bone marrow MSCs (hBMSCs) and subsequent osteogenic differentiation were examined. hBMSCs spreading, distribution and morphology were greatly affected by different roughness levels. A significantly higher level of Ln-5 secretion was detected on R2, which correlated to the local cell density regulated by the rough surface. Ln-5 binding integrins (α2 and α3) were strongly activated on R2. In addition, the results from hBMSCs on R0 inserts with different cell densities further confirmed that local cell density regulated Ln-5 secretion and cell surface integrin activation. In addition, the mineralization level of MSCs on R2 was remarkably higher than that on R0 and R1. These results suggest that hBMSC osteogenic differentiation level on R2 roughness was enhanced via increased Ln-5 secretion that was attributed to rough surface regulated local cell density. Thus, the microroughness could serve as effective topographical stimulus in cell culture devices and bone implant materials."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Electrospinning has attracted significant attention as a method to produce cell culture substrates whose fibrous structure mimics the native extracellular matrix (ECM). In this study, the influence of E-modulus of fibrous substrates on the lineage commitment of human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) was studied using fiber meshes prepared via the electrospinning of a polyetheresterurethane (PEEU) consisting of poly(ρ-dioxanone) (PPDO) and poly(ɛ-caprolactone) (PCL) segments. The PPDO: PCL weight ratio was varied from 40:60 to 70:30 to adjust the physiochemical properties of the PEEU fibers. The cells attached on stiffer PEEU70 (PPDO:PCL,= 70:30) fiber meshes displayed an elongated morphology compared to those cultured on softer fibers. The nuclear aspect ratio (width vs. length of a nucleus) of hADSCs cultured on softer PEEU40 (PPDO:PCL = 40:60) fibers was lower than on stiffer fibers. The osteogenic differentiation of hADSCs was enhanced by culturing on stiffer fibers. Compared to PEEU40, a 73% increase of osteocalcin expression and a 34% enhancement of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was observed in cells on PEEU70. These results demonstrated that the differentiation commitment of stem cells could be regulated via tailoring the mechanical properties of electrospun fibers."@en ;

METHODS: 30 patients (between 2018 and 2019) with secondary upper extremity lymphedema refractory to conservative therapy (manual lymph drainage and compression therapy were operated using the “simplified lymphovenous anastomosis” method). For the assessment of lymphatic supermicrosurgery, an operating microscope in which a near-infrared illumination system is integrated (Leica M530 OHX with glow technology ULT530, Leica Microsystems) and the IC-FlowTM Imaging System(Diagnostic Green)/Visionsense System (Medtronic) together with a ZEISS S8 microscope was used. Augmented reality intraoperative indocyanin green (ICG) lymphography-navigated modified “simplified lymphovenous anastomosis” were performed on the Leica microscope. All patients were informed about Off-label-use of ICG lymphography.   RESULTS: 57 LVAs were performed with modified “simplified lymphovenous anastomosis” lymphography-guidance on 30 upper extremities. All patients showed good patency after lymphovenous anastomosis.   CONCLUSIONS: Supermicrosurgery in the case of LVA is minimally invasive, highly effective, and shows a very low complication rate. The surgeon/equipment-related factors restrict the pratice of LVA, and its effectiveness limited by technical constraints."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "INTRODUCTION: Multiparametric-Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI)-Ultrasound fusion guided biopsy (Fbx) has emerged as the new standard of risk stratification for prostate cancer (PCa) with superior detection rates of clinically significant PCa than randomized biopsy. In the present study, we evaluated patients with suspicion of clinically significant PCa on mpMRI, but histopathologically proven Gleason 6 PCa in Fbx.   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 2015 and 2019, 849 patients underwent Fbx and concurrent systematic 12-core biopsy at our department. 234 patients were diagnosed with Gleason 6 PCa in either mpMRI-targeted and/or concurrent systematic biopsy. Patients were analyzed regarding PSA, mpMRI findings according to PI-RADS classification, histopathological results of Fbx and systematic 12-core biopsy. 99/234 patients were also analyzed in regards of histopathology of the whole-mount specimen of subsequent radical prostatectomy (RP).   RESULTS: In 131/234 patients (56%), Gleason 6 PCa was detected in the mpMRI target. In 103/234 patients (44%), Gleason 6 PCa was detected in the concurrent systematic 12-core biopsy with negative mpMRI-targeted biopsy. Men with evidence of Gleason 6 in the mpMRI target had significantly higher amounts of overall positive biopsies (median 4 vs. 2, p < 0.001) and higher maximum tumor infiltration per biopsy core (30% vs. 20%, p < 0.001) compared to men with negative mpMRI-targeted biopsy. Detection of Gleason 6 in mpMRI Target lesions correlated significantly with the PI-RADS score (p < 0.001). Patients with positive mpMRI-target had significantly higher tumor infiltration in whole-mount specimen after prostatectomy (20% vs. 15%, p = 0.0026) compared to men without detection of Gleason 6 in mpMRI-targeted biopsy but in additional systematic biopsy.   CONCLUSION: Detection of Gleason 6 PCa in mpMRI-targeted biopsy indicates higher tumor burden compared to detection of Gleason 6 PCa in concurrent systematic biopsy and negative mpMRI-targeted biopsy."@en ;

This aim of this review was to describe the client satisfaction on the services of Emergency department and the quality of emergency medical care in Ethiopia.   METHOD:  We searched peer-reviewed published articles related to clients’ satisfaction on emergency department services and the quality of emergency medical care between January 2000 and December 2017. The articles were retrieved from databases of PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, EMBASE and ScienceDirect. Furthermore, studies published in other language than English was excluded.   RESULTS:  A total of 2094 participants: 906 (43%) males and 1188 (57%) females were recruited in those reviewed papers to express their satisfaction on the service and the quality of emergency medical care of the Emergency department. Based on the study findings, majority 1177 (56%) of the participants were satisfied by emergency outpatient department (OPD) services. The majority 1018 (83%) of the participants were satisfied with the manner that was showed by the staffs working at the Emergency OPD. In similar manner, the satisfaction level of the participants in the Emergency OPD towards the accessibility of the emergency care services, courtesy of the staffs, quality of the services, physical environments, and existence of good communication with services provider were 72%, 97%, 81.5%, 55%, and 66%, respectively while 97.2% of them were dissatisfied with their privacy. On the other hand, 76% of the participants were satisfied with the service provided in the radiology section and other laboratory work.   CONCLUSION:  This study finding shown that there was the variety of client perception on the emergency department and its quality care.

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "PURPOSE:  Famines and food shortages are one of the most common long time histories of Ethiopia. Hence, malnutrition has been persisted at alarming raters in the country. Moreover, it is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Afar National Regional State of Ethiopia. Specifically, in Amibara and Awash Fentale districts. The anthropometric data were presented on height, weight, MUAC, weight/height/Age and Body Mass Index (BMI) of under-five children.   METHODS:  A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted from March 01, 2017 to June 15, 2018. The data was collected by using anthropometric measurement. A multi stage random sampling procedure was applied in order to recruit the required sample size. The data collections were conducted at two selected districts in Afar region by trained interviewers and health care providers. The data were analyzed by using SPSS Version 23. Bivariate analysis between dependent and independent variables was employed. Multivariate analysis was also done to control for possible confounding variable by selecting variable which show statistically significant association (P< 0.05).   RESULTS:  Out of 410 under five children’s anthropometric finding, the majorities (62.7%) of those registered under five children were male and (33.3%) were female. The majority (46.8%) of under five children were less than or equal to 50 cm by their height. Most (54.1%) of under five children were less than or equal to 12.5 cm by their MUAC. It indicated that they were diagnosed with severe malnutrition based on anthropometric measurements. Meanwhile, majority (64%) of under five children were less than 60% their weight/age. Regression analysis result indicated that all of the variables were not significant predictors of BMI for under five children (P> 0.05). Based on ANOVA result, there was significant difference between sex and other predictors (P= 0.031). This finding implies that improvement in food aid and poverty alleviation programs are very important. Based on the finding, it is important to provide high quality and quantity of food. Moreover, less access to assets and health services commonly contributed for malnutrition. Highlighting under five children’s malnutrition will help to develop and design future policies and programs in Ethiopia."@en ;

Although white matter hyperintensities (WMH) as expressions of cerebral small vessel disease are associated with physical and cognitive decline and could manifest as CF, this association remains yet to be clarified.   Objects: To clarify the association between CF and WMH among memory clinic patients.   Methods: The subjects of this cross-sectional study were 121 cognitively normal (CN) and 212 mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) patients who presented to the Memory Clinic at the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology of Japan. PF status was defined based on the definition proposed by Fried and colleagues. CF was defined as simultaneous presence of pre-PF or PF and MCI. WMH volumes were measured using an automatic segmentation application. Multiple liner regression analyses with adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors were performed.   Results: Of all subjects, 77 (63.6%) and 22 (18.2%) CN patients and 132 (62.3%) and 65 (30.7%) MCI patients were categorized into pre-PF and PF, respectively. Multiple liner regression analysis showed that those with CF had higher WMH volumes than those without (β= 0.23). When categorized into six groups according to PF and cognitive status, the PF/CN (β= 0.15), pre-PF/MCI (β= 0.41), and PF/MCI (β= 0.34) groups had higher WMH volumes than the non-PF/CN group.   Conclusions: This study showed increased WMH volumes in CF and PF, indicating that WMH could be one of the key underlying brain pathologies of CF."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Slowed behavioral reaction time is associated with pathological brain changes, including white matter lesions, the common clinical characteristic of subcortical ischemic vascular cognitive impairment (SIVCI). In the present study, reaction time (RT) employing Trails B of the Trail Making Test, with responses capped at 300 s, was investigated in SIVCI (n = 27) compared to cognitively healthy aging (CH) (n = 26). RT was significantly slowed in SIVCI compared to CH (Cohen’s d effect size = 1.26). Furthermore, failure to complete Trails B within 300 s was also a characteristic of SIVCI although some ostensibly cognitively healthy older adults also failed to complete within this time limit. Within the SIVCI group, RT did not differ significantly with respect to whether the patients were classified as having moderate/severe or mild, periventricular white matter changes visible on their diagnostic CT/MRI scans. This, together with the high degree of overlap in RT between the two SIVCI subgroups, raises the possibility that using visible ratings scales in isolation may lead to the underestimation of disease level."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: In cardiovascular research small pigs breeds like Göttingen® minipigs (GM) are established animal models, but systematic data about the micromorphology of the GM vasculature at different ages are scarce.   OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed at gaining knowledge about the micromorphology of the femoral artery (FA) from German Landrace pigs (DL) and GM during the period of growth over a body weight range of 10–40 kg.   METHODS: FA samples from DL aged two or three months were compared to GM ones, aged 18 or 40 months using transmitted light microscopy.   RESULTS: All FA samples showed typical characteristics of muscular arteries. Growth was associated with increased vessel wall thickness. In the GM this resulted in a slight decrease of the luminal diameter (LD), while in the DL pigs, an increase of the LD and smooth muscle cell content (10%) with decreased elastic fiber content (10%) has been detected. In contrast, within the 22 months lasting growth period of the GM, the tunica media content of smooth muscle cells and elastic fibers remained stable.   CONCLUSIONS: FA maturation strongly depends on the pig breed and age. It can be different from what is described in humans."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of soft tissue defects with free flaps is a common procedure in plastic and reconstructive surgery. Most postoperative complications occur within the first 48–72 hours after surgery. After postoperative complications, short perfusion restoration times may improve flap survival rates by up to 30–50%. Ratiometric fluorescence imaging is an additional or alternative method of postoperative flap monitoring.   OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and utility of transepidermal oxygen flux imaging to evaluate postoperative skin oxygenation of free and local flaps in the first 48 hours after surgery.   METHODS: The study included 32 patients (aged between 18 and 80 years; mean age 52.9) with a tissue defect covered with a free flap transplant at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery of the University Medical Center Regensburg. Postoperative oxygen flux was measured with the ‘VisiSens system’ placed on the vascular pedicle as well as on the peripheral and central part of the flap.   RESULTS: Values of oxygen flux were higher in case of flap congestion (0.069±0.012) or flap necrosis (0.155±0.083) than in cases without any complications (0.061±0.006). Flux values of different areas of the same flap showed only minimal differences (central part: 0.065±0.008, peripheral part: 0.070±0.009, vascular pedicle: 0.056±0.004); the level of significance was p = 0.904.   CONCLUSION: Imaging transepidermal oxygen flux by ratiometric luminescence seems to be a reliable alternative, indirect method of postoperative flap monitoring with regard to microcirculatory function and flap viability."@en ;

We quantified plasma lipids using untargeted liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry in a total of 152 non-demented participants aged 65–100 years carrying at least one ɛ2 or ɛ4 allele (ɛ2/ɛ2 or ɛ2/ɛ3, n = 38: ɛ4/ɛ3 or ɛ4/ɛ4, n = 38), who were roughly matched to an ɛ3/ɛ3 control by age, sex, and lipid-lowering medication (n = 76). Low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were genotype dependent (ɛ4/ɛ4> ɛ4/ɛ3> ɛ3/ɛ3> ɛ2/ɛ3> ɛ2/ɛ2). The greatest variation in lipids was related to the ɛ2 isoform, where various lysophosphatidylcholines and all phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) subclasses were elevated relative to ɛ3/ɛ3 and ɛ4 carriers. APOE ɛ4 carriers had reduced phosphatidylinositol relative to ɛ3/ɛ3 and ɛ2 carriers. Logistic regression revealed that ɛ2 carriers were at least 4 times higher odds of being in the highest tertile of PE lipid level relative to ɛ3/ɛ3. The elevation in PE and other phospholipids in ɛ2 carriers may indicate the protective effect of ɛ2 is linked to these phospholipids. Additionally, high baseline PE in cognitively normal participants predicted protection against cognitive decline six years later. Our data suggest substantial modulation of plasma lipids by APOE genotype and therefore indicates possible lipid targets and pathomechanisms involved in AD risk."@en ;

Targeting cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors may be potential mechanisms to modify AD risk and address racial/ethnic disparities in AD dementia.   Objective: This study investigated relationships among cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, APOE genotype, AD biomarkers, and intracranial arterial blood flow in Whites and African Americans enriched for AD risk.   Methods: 399 cognitively unimpaired adults from the Wisconsin Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center completed physical and neuroimaging examinations. A 4D Flow MRI sequence (phase-contrast vastly under sampled isotropic projection imaging) measured intracranial arterial flow in the Circle of Willis. Linear mixed-effects regression models estimated relationships between risk factors and intracranial arterial flow and tested interactions with racial group, APOE genotype, and AD biomarkers, with separate models per risk factor.   Results: Higher fasting glucose was associated with lower intracranial arterial flow; no additional relationships between flow and risk factors were observed. Main effects of racial group were observed, without an interaction, indicating lower flow in African Americans compared to Whites. In race-stratified analyses, higher glucose and triglycerides were associated with lower flow for African Americans, but not for Whites. No main effects or interactions among risk factors, APOE, or AD biomarkers, and flow were observed.   Conclusion: Elevated fasting glucose and triglycerides were associated with lower intracranial arterial flow; these relationships were more prominent in African Americans. Targeting metabolic risk factors may impact intracranial arterial health. Additional research is needed to determine if this will impact disparities in dementia prevalence."@en ;

Rehabilitation patients tend to lack exposure to sufficient natural light.   OBJECTIVE: Installed diurnal naturalistic light may reduce the known disrupted sleep quality and fatigue seen in post stroke patients.   METHODS: Stroke patients were randomized to either an intervention rehabilitation unit (IU) equipped with naturalistic lighting (artificial sunlight spectrum) or to a control rehabilitation unit (CU) with standard indoor lighting. At inclusion and discharge, fatigue and subjective sleep quality were measured.   RESULTS: Ninety stroke patients were included between May 2014, and June 2015. At discharge, patients from the IU experienced less fatigue than the CU patients, based on the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory questionnaire general (IU, n = 28; CU, n = 30; diff – 20.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) [– 35.0%; – 3.0%]; P = 0.025) and the Rested Statement (IU, n = 28; CU, n = 30; diff + 41.6%, 95% CI [+4.6%; +91.8%]; P = 0.025). No differences were detected between groups in sleepiness or subjective sleep quality by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "AIM: Evaluation of the post-interventional success following ablative techniques (radiofrequency and microwave) using a new color coded perfusion quantification software with CEUS in patients with primary and secondary liver malignancies.   MATERIAL AND METHODS: 75 patients (60 males, 15 females, age 24–84 years, mean 62.7 years) with 128 malignant liver lesions were included in this study. Between 01/2013 and 06/2018, the therapeutic interventional procedure in 88 lesions was MWA, in 40 lesions RFA. All patients underwent CEUS using a convex multifrequency probe (1–6 MHz) following application of 1–2.4 ml sulphur hexaflouride microbubbles, before and within 24 hours following RFA and MWA to detect residual tumor tissue. Postprocessing of the stored DICOM loops from 15 sec up to 1 min using a perfusion quantification software regarding peak enhancement (pE), time to peak (TTP), mean transit time (MTT), rise time (Ri) and Wash-in area under the curve (WiAUC) in the center of the lesion, the border area and periphery was performed.   RESULTS: In patients treated with RFA, pE differences between center of the lesion vs. surrounding liver were found to be statistically extremely significant (p < 0.001), differences between center of the lesion and margin were also statistically significant (p < 0.01). mTT, TTP, WiAuC and Ri showed no significant difference between center, margin or surrounding liver. In patients treated with MWA, statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found for pE, Ri and mTT regarding the differences between center of lesion and surrounding tissue. WiAuC and TTP showed no significant differences between center, margin or surrounding liver.   CONCLUSION: CEUS with perfusion imaging is a valuable supporting tool for post-interventional success control following RFA and MWA of primary and secondary liver maligancies. Focus should be placed upon pE following MWA and pE, Ri and mTT following RFA."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Background: Although hydromethylthionine is a potent tau aggregation inhibitor, no difference was found in either of two Phase III trials in mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD) comparing doses in the range 150–250 mg/day with 8 mg/day intended as a control.   Objective: To determine how drug exposure is related to treatment response.   Methods: A sensitive plasma assay for the drug was used in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of samples from 1,162 of the 1,686 patients who participated in either of the Phase III trials with available samples and efficacy outcome data.   Results: There are steep concentration-response relationships for steady state plasma levels in the range 0.3–0.8 ng/ml at the 8 mg/day dose. Using a threshold based on the lower limit of quantitation of the assay on Day 1, there are highly significant differences in cognitive decline and brain atrophy in patients with above threshold plasma levels, both for monotherapy and add-on therapy, but with effect sizes reduced by half as add-on. Plasma concentrations in the range 4–21 ng/ml produced by the high doses are not associated with any additional benefit.   Conclusions: Hydromethylthionine has pharmacological activity on brain structure and function at the 8 mg/day dose as monotherapy or as add-on to symptomatic treatments. This combined with a plateau at higher doses is consistent with the lack of dose-response seen in the Phase III trials. Treatment benefit is predicted to be maximal at 16 mg/day as monotherapy. A placebo-controlled trial in mild/moderate AD is now ongoing to confirm efficacy at this dose."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Repeated injections of iodinated contrast media (CM) can lead to a deterioration of the renal blood flow, can redistribute blood from the renal cortex to other parts of the kidney and can cause small decreases of the blood flow in cortical capillaries, a significant reduction in blood flow in peritubular capillaries and a significant reduction in blood flow in the vasa recta. Therefore, a study in pigs was designed, to show whether the repeated injection of CM boli, alone, can cause a reduction of oxygenation in the cortico-medullar renal tissue – the region with the highest oxygen demand in the kidney - of pigs. While the mean pO2-value had only decreased by 0.3 mmHg from 29.9±4.3 mmHg to 29.6±4.3 mmHg (p = 0.8799) after the tenth Iodixanol bolus, it decreased by 5.9 mmHg from 34.0±4.3 mmHg to 28.1±4.3 mmHg after the tenth Iopromide bolus (p = 0.044). This revealed a remarkable difference in the influence of these CM on the oxygen partial pressure in the kidney. Repeated applications of CM had a significant influence on the renal oxygen partial pressure. In line with earlier studies showing a redistribution of blood from the cortex to other renal areas, this study revealed that Iodixanol – in contrast to Iopromide - induced no changes in the pO2 in the cortico-medullar region which confirms that Iodixanol did not hinder the flow of blood through the renal micro-vessels. These results are in favor of a hypothesis from Brezis that a microcirculatory disorder might be the basis for the development of CI-AKI."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are increasingly being studied as a source of cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, and several groups have reported their beneficial effects on Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this study using AD model mice (APdE9), we found that transplantation of MSC via the tail vein improved spatial memory in the Morris water maze test. Using electron paramagnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the in vivo redox state of the brain, we found that MSC transplantation suppressed oxidative stress in AD model mice. To elucidate how MSC treatment ameliorates oxidative stress, we focused on amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and microglial function. MSC transplantation reduced Aβ deposition in the cortex and hippocampus. Transplantation of MSC also decreased Iba1-positive area in the cortex and reduced activated ameboid shaped microglia. On the other hand, MSC transplantation accelerated accumulation of microglia around Aβ deposits and prompted microglial Aβ uptake and clearance as shown by higher frequency of Aβ-containing microglia. MSC transplantation also increased CD14-positive microglia in vivo, which play a critical role in Aβ uptake. To confirm the effects of MSC on microglia, we co-cultured the mouse microglial cell line MG6 with MSC. Co-culture with MSC enhanced Aβ uptake by MG6 cells accompanied by upregulation of CD14 expression. Additionally, co-culture of MG6 cells with MSC induced microglial phenotype switching from M1 to M2 and suppressed production of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that MSC treatment has the potential to ameliorate oxidative stress through modification of microglial functions, thereby improving Aβ pathology in AD model mice."@en ;

    ns2:hasPubAbstract "Diffusion changes as determined by diffusion tensor imaging are potential indicators of microstructural lesions in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), prodromal Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and AD dementia. Here we extended the scope of analysis toward subjective cognitive complaints as a pre-MCI at risk stage of AD. In a cohort of 271 participants of the prospective DELCODE study, including 93 healthy controls and 98 subjective cognitive decline (SCD), 45 MCI, and 35 AD dementia cases, we found reductions of fiber tract integrity in limbic and association fiber tracts in MCI and AD dementia compared with controls in a tract-based analysis (p < 0.05, family wise error corrected). In contrast, people with SCD showed spatially restricted white matter alterations only for the mode of anisotropy and only at an uncorrected level of significance. DTI parameters yielded a high cross-validated diagnostic accuracy of almost 80% for the clinical diagnosis of MCI and the discrimination of Aβ positive MCI cases from Aβ negative controls. In contrast, DTI parameters reached only random level accuracy for the discrimination between Aβ positive SCD and control cases from Aβ negative controls. These findings suggest that in prodromal stages of AD, such as in Aβ positive MCI, multicenter DTI with prospectively harmonized acquisition parameters yields diagnostic accuracy meeting the criteria for a useful biomarker. In contrast, automated tract-based analysis of DTI parameters is not useful for the identification of preclinical AD, including Aβ positive SCD and control cases."@en ;
